Pronouncing is a simple interface for the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary. It's easy
to use and has no external dependencies. For example, here's how to find rhymes
for a given word::

    >>> import pronouncing
    >>> pronouncing.rhymes("climbing")
    ['diming', 'liming', 'priming', 'rhyming', 'timing']

Read the documentation here: https://pronouncing.readthedocs.org.

I made Pronouncing because I wanted to be able to use the CMU Pronouncing
Dictionary in my projects (and teach other people how to use it) without having
to install the grand behemoth that is NLTK.

Installation
------------

Install with pip like so::

    pip install pronouncing

You can also download the source code and install manually::

    python setup.py install
