"Truth"says the truism"has a scratched face."
Tell me
the story of that scratch.
*
"If it thows it," said the mechanic in Macon,
"if it thows a rod, you gon know it."
I knew it
not. Every mile in that red Fairlane
with each pothole or engine-clunk
I worried it had already thrown it
and I was too oblivious to tell.
*
"Like a compound bone fracture
breaking through the skin," says Car Talk:
when the crankshaft's connecting rod
busts loose and splits through the engine block. It
throws a rod. Truth
has a clawed face. Truth
spine-bristles, spits back.
*
Sud-scraping the soap dish:
old soap needs new
to scrub off the soap scum
from latherslab that floated
in handwashing water, dried, then fouled
along the dish ridges: fat-gunk and fetor.
It takes soap to wash off soap, as
only words can say
what other words
might mean.
Antonymous ≠
its synonyms
inimical, oppugnant, dead against,
and the like.
*
If it thows it and you don't even know it:
Fairlane cruising while the rod
secretly and inwardly
blasts loose.
Truth's face so gashed you don't recognize it.
What does this proverb mean to you:
"One cannot be
and have been?"
What lather can cleanse the soap scum
of a question I heard in a philosophy lecture
forty years ago:
"What's the difference between no longer being
and never having been?"
It thows it, sometimes, and you know it.
"Big flies," the adage goes, "break the spider web." Silk-
wrapped in it; thorax torn and tearing: dead
against it.
*
"Sir, I'll tell you your problem, sir. Sir, you ain't got no engine, sir"'
The ex-Marine mechanic scowled down the open hood,
cicada-buzzthrob through dry miles of kudzu and gnat-swarm
in eye-wet.
"Well, what's that?" I asked, pointing at the engine.
"Sir, believe me, you ain't got no engine. Sir."
I ain't got no engine. It thowed it. I should have known it.
Gas-blast in cylinder
blows piston to connecting
rod to crankshaft to
wheel-screech and dust cloud in rearview,
but now: dead-clunk of rod half smashed through block.
I ain't got no. I ain't got no. I ain't got no.
*
"The truth lies,"
They say, "at the bottom of a well."
"It's unnecessary,"
They say too, "to fish up every bucket
that falls into the well."
It takes
words to scratch through to the truth
of words: verity, conformity, reality, the like.
Meaning's
the handle that metal-scrapes
and clangs against
language, its bobbing and disattached bucket,
when I go for a draft:
slime-green, algal, cold.
Scratch means "nothing." Arbitrary
no time
to set off from,
to floor it toward
never having been,
rod holding steady to its piston. Like any word, truth
slinks away when you say it:
spit-slicked, stripe-scratched, gut-
growling, and declawed.
*
Still floating on the current,
this last stretch before the sea,
like so many we fished together
through what seemed an endless river
of summer afternoonsthis one
as familiar as it isn't, hurrying more
the further we goour conversations
about the words of which things are made,
stilled now to become just the things
themselves, the purling and the rings
of water reaching out from our casts,
heard now only with our eyes
as I stand in the bow, watching
my fly float high on its hackle
along the grassy bank,
careful not to let my gaze
drift back to where
you would always be,
sitting behind me, a wreath
of cigarette smoke
the strange feeling you said
you sometimes had, letting
a trout go after all
the concentration of catching it
more like Mozart
than Wagner, you said,
your good right eye
watching for the rise of a life
your blind left, not too far
downstream, already absorbed
Jade-starred       entity
lacing                 embarking in
the self-spun                 curve
of recursive           tailspin
tangled              in turquoise
underwater       bluegrass
stealth-steps          like arabesque
a form             slips eternal
 
Corps de Ballet
A raft of tulle hovers
over feet in croisé:
skirts levitated under
arms' undulating
stems in photographic
white-life : twilit
mast mi-creature
or marine
 
Ars Poetica
Thirty miles to the only decent restaurant 
was nothing, a blink 
in the long dull stare of Wyoming. 
Halfway there the unknown but terribly 
important essayist yelled Stop! 
I wanna be in this; and walked 
fifteen yards onto the land 
before sky bore down and he came running,
crying Jesusthere's nothing out there! 
I once met an Australian novelist 
who told me he never learned to cook 
because it robbed creative energy. 
What he wanted most was 
to be mute; he stacked up pages; 
he entered each day with an ax. 
What I want is this poem to be small, 
a ghost town 
on the larger map of wills. 
Then you can pencil me in as a hawk: 
a traveling x-marks-the-spot. 
 
Evening Primrose
Neither rosy nor prim, 
not cousin to the cowslip 
nor the extravagant fuchsia
I doubt anyone has ever 
picked one for show, 
though the woods must be fringed 
with their lemony effusions. 
Sun blathers its baronial 
endorsement, but they refuse 
to join the ranks. Summer 
brings them in armfuls, 
yet, when the day is large, 
you won't see them fluttering 
the length of the road. 
Some of us
are chum.
Some of us
are the come-hither
honeycomb
gleamy in the middle
of the traps busted smile.
Though I let myself a little
off this hook, petard
by which I flail,
and fancy myself more
flattered  
no ugly worm!
Humor me
as hapless nymph,
straight outta Bullfinch, minding
my own beeswax,
gamboling, or picking flowers
(say daffodils),
doing that unspecified stuff
nymphs do
with their hours,
until spied by a layabout youth,
or rapey God
who leaps unerring, staglike,
quicker than smoke, to the wrong idea.
Or maybe
the right?
For didnt I supply
the tippy box, too?
Notch the stick on which
to prop it?
Didnt I fumble the clove hitch
for the rope?
Leave the trip lying obvious
in the tall, buggy grass?
Ever it was.
Duh.
Be the mat,
and the left foot finds you welcome.
Though theres always a subject, a him
or herself. But to name it
calls it down, like Betelgeuse,
or the IRS.
It must be swell
to have both deed and
the entitlement, for leaners who hold our lien,
consumers who consume like
red tide ripping through a coastal lake?
Who find themselves so very well
when gazing in that kiddie pool, or any
skinny inch of water.
That guy, remember? How tell this tale
without him? A story
so hoary, his names Pre-Greek.
What brought Narcissus down?
A spotty case
of the disdains, I think,
 Climbing over the gate into a garden 
for residents only or so it says 
being the perfect place to notice 
a green thought gaining ground 
from underneath the dreams 
I bring with me which seem to have 
more reality than can be accounted for 
I hold the key to this privacy 
Deterred
And so I came to be the man who hunched 
at the desk under the lamp for six blind months 
and followed the loops of cursive spiraling 
backward like the song of a wood thrush 
to the creek below the hermit's ink-black cave 
and the knob of water at its source braiding 
and unbraiding down rock shelves opening 
a crease into the stone of the hill. One night 
a storm thrashed the house, but I did not look up 
at the sound of rain's hard fist against the pane, 
or thunder kicking in a door. I was standing 
in the leafiest, greenest light, the stream beside me 
tumbling as it would unceasing from the nib 
so dazzlingly, so sparklingly ... no. And that 
was when I knew he'd heard it: a brittle sound 
like a dry leaf flipped by wind (a page turning), 
that was when I knew that he was clawing up 
through mud, rising strobed and tattered, 
and that soon I'd feel his boot steps on the porch, 
his hand reaching out, reaching for the screen door's 
latch that, grasped, became the pen I lifted. 
 
Old Stith
left behind 
your IV drip 
your cat 
and a man 
I don't know 
hugging me 
tightly crying 
that he'll 
miss you 
and your laughter 
I heard you 
cherished 
Baby-sitting
I am sitting in a strange room listening 
For the wrong baby. I don't love 
This baby. She is sleeping a snuffly 
Roseate, bubbling sleep; she is fair; 
She is a perfectly acceptable child. 
I am afraid of her. If she wakes 
She will hate me. She will shout 
Her hot midnight rage, her nose 
Will stream disgustingly and the perfume 
Of her breath will fail to enchant me. 
To her I will represent absolute 
Abandonment. For her it will be worse 
Than for the lover cold in lonely 
Sheets; worse than for the woman who waits 
A moment to collect her dignity 
Beside the bleached bone in the terminal ward. 
As she rises sobbing from the monstrous land 
Stretching for milk-familiar comforting, 
She will find me and between us two 
It will not come. It will not come. 
 
Apples
They fill with heat, dewfall, a night of rain. 
In a week they have reddened, the seed gone black 
in each star-heart. Soft thud of fruit 
in the deepening heat of the day. 
Out of the delicate petals of secret skin 
and that irreversible moment when the fruit set, 
such a hard harvest, so cold and sharp on the tongue. 
This is me, depressed out of my mind, 
frailing the banjo, spilling red wine 
on the white 
king-sized 
luckily-hotel's-and-not-my-
goose down comforter, this is me 
walking and waxing nostalgic through the girlish shadows 
of tall palm trees, the déjà vus 
flying through the scene 
suddenly, like those three 
unnameable and therefore beautiful white birds. 
This is me as a slowly-tearing-itself-apart cloud 
and marveling 
at a fire palely and flamily 
emerging from a bowl, wavering 
up through stones of cobalt glass. The air 
wavers back. This is me in love 
with the beauty of blue glass in flames, this is me on drugs 
prescribed by my doctor 
as I try once more 
to sneak into night's closely guarded city, 
my hollow horse ready 
to wreak my demons and Blue Morphos 
on the citizens of my sleep. I am most 
myself when flashing rapidly 
my iridescent wings, drinking 
the juice of fallen fruit. Then again 
look for me under your bed 
where the ugly premodern vampires 
still hide. The undead and I are lying 
in wait. We are very interested in you 
though this is still me. We are unstable and true. 
We believe in the one-ton rose 
and the displaced toilet equally. Our blues 
assume you understand 
not much, and try to be alive, just as we do, 
A moth lies open and lies 
like an old bleached beech leaf, 
a lean-to between window frame and sill. 
Its death protects a collection of tinier deaths 
and other dirts beneath. 
Although the white paint is water-stained, 
on it death is dirt, and hapless. 
The just-severed tiger lily 
is drinking its glass of water, I hope. 
This hope is sere. 
This hope is severe. 
What you ruin ruins you, too 
and so you hope for favor. 
I mean I do. 
The underside of a ladybug 
wanders the window. I wander 
the continent, my under-carriage not as evident, 
so go more perilously, it seems to me. 
But I am only me; to you it seems clear 
I mean to disappear, and am mean 
and project on you my fear. 
If I were a bug, I hope I wouldn't be 
this giant winged thing, spindly like a crane fly, 
skinny-legged like me, kissing the cold ceiling, 
fumbling for the face of the other, seeking. 
It came in with me last night when I turned on the light. 
I lay awake, afraid it would touch my face. 
It wants out. I want out, too. 
I am the keeper tells 
Me the most popular exhibit 
You might not think this cheers me but it does 
I'm given many opportunities 
I like especially to ask the groups 
Led by fat white men     I am careful to 
Never address the fat man but the group 
How has it come // To pass 
that I'm on this side of the bars 
And you're on that side 
And Who stands in your shoes 
You or the people you resemble 
they don't give me shoes // I say 
Gesturing toward a zoo employee 
and I smile 
Often the people do not answer me 
Often the fat man squints     and says It real- // ly makes you think 
Something like that     or There 
but for the grace of God      / I tell the keeper they must be 
The daughters and the sons of nearer gods 
I tell him my gods had to stay behind 
To watch my people     / He likes it when I talk like that 
the truth is I don't know 
The keeper      when he's drunk 
Sometimes he says I'm lucky 
To have been rescued from my gods 
And I should thank the man who bought me 
I used to laugh at him      but now I grieve 
I think // His god is not a god like mine     / His god 
Is not a mother     not a father 
not a hunter     not a farmer 
his / God is a stranger 
                                   I woke slightly out of breath. Winded from the ghosted 
run between the land of living and the country of my death, I'd drag my dreams 
behind me, from bed to desk, write poems of sleep and ink and newsprint. 
Ah sleep. Sleep and summer smoke. 
From its cage, the fan purred a noisy exhale. 
The mocking bird outside our bedroom window 
       sang in all the local tongues and dialects. 
Your car, leaving up the graveled drive, 
       made for a lonely sound
                                      and a relief. 
The dog would rest his head on cagey front paws, 
       make an effort at patience. The appliances would be truly patient 
              though full of curiosity 
                     about what might come next. 
The doorbell might have rung 
                                            if we'd had one. 
We'd listened to the forecast. Sony by the bed and bath. 
Bose above the compact discs and art books. 
Radio news unleashed and born again. 
Thank god, we'd say, for the "on" and "off" switch. 
Then one night a voice from dream announced, 
In one or two weeks there'll be a catastrophe. 
Winds were driven.      Waters rose.      Levees broke. 
I was walking away. 
As I moved, I knew: 
you were sleeping in our bed. 
I was pushing through time
aware of it
as I slid 
toward another world 
that seemed 
enveloped 
by the sheath 
of an indecipherable hum. 
Cupped 
inside that moment, 
I began to surface: 
a sense of rising, the earth I 
could feel lifting with me 
toward a blurred layer 
in the sky 
It's not worth it to me to ask 
whether you love me, 
whether you're happy, 
whether this arrangement works for you. 
The senator's son wasn't supposed to tell 
anyone his mother and father were drunks 
he loved. Like you and me, he was the secret 
they counted on, to hold things in. 
What's a family for, if not to vote for itself? 
I had proof of this in my living room, 
that voting box. And today, outside, watching 
the turkeys wobbling around 
October's drops, the apples fermenting 
inside their skins. 
Yellow jackets and bees drilling 
into their tapped kegs. Stinging whatever 
they can, not telling anyone who they're 
voting for. Confusing isn't it, how a little 
of something can become too much? 
How there's a Kennedy in each of us, 
I'm running down the corridors, 
        Late for my watch on the bridge, 
For captain's mast, for General Quarters. 
        It's winter, my face frigid: 
Why is my uniform tropical white? 
        Down the passageway 
Of shadowless fluorescent light 
        I gasp, but the view stays 
Unchangeda tunnel of painted steel. 
        I'm yelling: I did my time
And I resigned! This can't be real! 
        But all the ladders I climb 
Now lead to where the lifeboat is stored. 
        The PA speakers blast: 
Man overboard! Man overboard! 
        The boat's being lowered. I'm last 
                      Our guide Leyla says "don't be disappointed" before we go 
to Troy, and when I say I understand there's not much there, 
                      she says, "Thank God for this one, Mr. DavidI believe 
           some of your fellow countrymen are expecting to see Brad Pitt, 
                      not to mention Orlando Bloom, Eric Bana, and other stars 
of the celebrated if not very excellent 2004 Hollywood movie!" 
                      But that's America for you: travelers to Paris never 
           never believe me when I tell them the Bastille was torn down, 
                      or if they do, they assume it's for the same reason we tear 
things down here at home, that is, to put a McFriendly's in its place. 
                      There's no reason to get all worked up over it, though: 
           "Should I kill myself or have a cup of coffee?" asks novelist Albert 
                      Camus. Have a cup of coffee, Albert! You can always kill 
yourself later. You can always read philosopher Gaston Bachelard, 
                      who says the truest thing: Bachelard says 
           we always begin in joy and end by organizing our disappointment, 
                      that whereas the moment of discovery is always fresh 
and unfiltered, the moment of organization is when we 
                      exchange the pleasure we get from experiencing 
           something for the pleasure we get from thinking about it. Boy, 
                      does that ever sound French! It also sounds very much like 
what I do when I write a poem, but it sounds as well like my thoughts 
                      on the last overpriced restaurant meal I ate, 
           not to mention the American political system, which is the point: 
                      we take off from one place, then we're all over the map, 
and now, because we're earnest and fundamentally decent 
                      and have been up a time or two before, 
           we're bringing that thought in for a nice soft landing. Troy really 
                      is pretty awful: it's like your backyard, assuming your 
backyard is full of rocks and gulleys and the odd historical plaque 
                      here and there. Who cares? Here is where 
           the Greeks clash with the Trojans, I say as I pound my chest, here 
                      where Patroclus falls, then Hector, where the arrows 
of Hercules rain down and the hammer of Ajax drives men into the ground 
                      like tent pegs! After we walk all over the ruins 
           of the ancient citywhich is raggedy, yes, but nobody ever said it was 
                      smallwe repair with Leyla to the restaurant just outside, 
and as we attack our excellent Turkish lunches, suddenly 
                      Leyla looks up and says, "Ha, halook, 
           there's Helen!" and sure enough, a blonde maiden is walking through 
                      the parking lot, someone from Latvia, I'm guessing, 
or the Czech Republic, and she looks a little sad, 
                      and when she enters the restaurant 
           and sits, it is at the table of a man close to twice her age, her father, 
                      perhaps, though I'm thinking that, if she is Helen, 
the older man might be her Menelaus, which explains why 
                      she is out of countenance, and as we tuck 
           into our lamb and pilaf and peppers and eggplant, I wonder 
                      if somewhere a Paris is waiting, not in the city 
of the same name but in Riga or Prague, and he's at a sidewalk café, 
                      eating a pierogi or whatever they eat there, though 
           actually he's not eating at all, he's so lovesick, but is drinking 
                      instead cup after cup of black coffee, and he's thinking 
of how he kissed her that one time before she left for Troy, 
                      how he put his hands on her hips and she hers 
           on his shoulder and he gave her a sort of tentative, is-this-okay kiss, 
                      and she reacted, like, yeah, it's more than okay, and 
then, poof, she's gone, as in out of his life forever if he doesn't 
                      do something, only here he is in Prague 
           or Riga, and the waiter comes by and says Something wrong 
With rusty joints, collapsible, 
forgotten, it's a memento mori of sorts, 
a reminder of how soon 
you become blind to a place 
and why you visit 
this walkway over the dunes 
one more gazer at the blue-green swells. 
All through the summer, a woman, 
slim, blond, and attractive, 
would sit in a black two-piece 
between the dunes 
              in that yellow chair 
beneath an umbrella with her dog, 
always reading a novel. 
A widow, some say. 
Clouds billowed offshore 
and surfers rode the big waves in. 
But she rarely looked up. 
When she went for a swim 
her golden retriever went too 
until she told him to stay 
and he would lie above the tide line 
keeping close watch. 
4. Night 
In dreams I am 
without machine. 
No airfoil, stick, 
rudder 
a different physics 
buoys me 
kicking past cloud-forms 
into each 
moment 
each moment. 
 
6. Assembly 
They are sleeping. 
On beds of polished 
tooling, in sheets 
of mylar and copper, 
they sleep. 
With rigid fittings. 
With drills and dies 
loaned by the tool 
crib, they wait 
for weld tips 
and bonding agents. 
For curing agents 
and solvent baths; 
gloved hands, masked 
faces, and final 
accoutrement 
of fine wiring 
in this cradle 
of circuit boards 
and solar panels: 
the ultra-clean 
unfinished innards 
and exoskeletons 
of spacecraft. 
 
7. Maze 
I didn't find a monster at the core. 
No sacrifice. No thread to lead me out. 
But I imagined the bureaucrats and brass 
had a darker purpose than the safety 
of democracy. Inside the cubicles, 
the bull pens, the long bare halls with portals 
to clock our every crossing, a unity 
was lost on me. Much spoken of, but missing. 
 
10. Laboratory 
Three flights 
up to the ladies' 
room. 
Cracked paint. 
Basement labs 
where my data 
gather, a smattering 
of electrons 
in a vacuum chamber. 
My grandfather built optics here. 
My father followed 
in a crew cut, 
white shirt, narrow tie. 
In snapshots 
and clippings I see 
men smile. 
The hard 
truth shines
Pioneer, Ranger, Mariner.
Aluminum soldiers. 
Unswerving. 
Years later he 
tells me one 
I love reading books no one else finds interesting 
Drenched in sunscreen, savoring the same sentence multiple times 
Out of a kind of hypnotic repetition, like wave-watching, although sometimes 
I reread that same sentence out of bad concentration, distracted by a man with 
     leather 
Skin & an entire body tattooed till I bore myself so much I take a long walk 
To the breakers to see what evolutionary ancestors other week-end people are 
     reeling in. 
I look at children, burrowing in obsessed concentration, sand collapsing 
On itself, the ocean futilely filling the holes, & I imagine their resignation as adults, 
Burying their own parents. I stare at snoozing grown-ups & assume 
They must have at one point been children, covering each other in the sand. 
Sometimes I sense in the grown-up faces how their lives have been 
Sandblasted by heartache & disillusionment & must be carefully 
Shaken out, neatly folded, before they pack them up. 
It so happens when I read my book I often skip a sentence 
Or two: what's the difference, all lives contain 
Their own little gaps: a sort of necessary evolutionary denial I suppose, 
Selective life-omissions that promote survival, but one can figure out 
The mysteries left out from the context & ultimately, what does it matter? 
Often I stay so long I wander the sparse penumbra of the parking lot 
Until only a few vehicles remain which makes it quite easy to find 
What brought me here & what will transport me home. 
Too many of us have awakened the morning after a beach day, 
Sun poisoned & discovered we've lost one vitally important, essential, 
Irreplaceable, flip-flop. One has no real choice but to throw the remaining 
The sun goes down, we say,
but thats not right. 
Still, night falls 
on the tragedys final act. 
The first star like a pinprick in tin.
And how to pierce through.
I was looking for a metaphor. 
For someone who knows the way. 
On the shelf a book titled 
The Sight of Death. 
On the shelf a little bottle 
to keep age away.
Thei made theire bokis to many men ful derk
In poyses, parabols, & in methaphoris alle-so
this from the Ordinal of Alchemy. 
Given change, he sought it
in a book he called Believe Me.
In the dark of night I trace his script.
Stars bore through the black.
Shadow or shade, elemental also. 
A continent away, daylight, 
and all the named things still seen: 
Cocks Foot, Germander Speedwell.
As in Dürers painting of turf, 1503, 
rhizomous white roots and the push
of green take the undying field.
How can you be alive you growths of spring?
Whitman wonders, fed by death,
in the poem my friend loves.
The field itself, some kind of bed.
For what sleep. She wrote that this 
spring may be her last. I lay 
on the damp earth, in the grass 
interwoven with the dozens of plants 
Id thought nameless, the little white 
daisy-like flowers and the tendrils 
of the tiny striated blue ones, 
which have, as it happens, not only 
the one name Speedwell but many more 
besides, Birds Eye, Cats Eye, Farewell 
and Goodbye. You were to stitch a posy 
of it onto the beloveds coat 
before a journey, the boat leaving 
for what distant shore. The passengers
reluctant to go, as is the poem
that knows it has to come to an end, 
and refuses, like a child stalling 
before bed, not tired yet or scared 
of the dark. Every death takes 
a body; its hard to know what it leaves. 
Already it has stitched its signature 
into her chest, the scars that chart 
her illness like lines on a map 
that show where the ship has sailed, 
struck rock, found the ocean too deep 
to anchor and so drifted windless, 
the sea, like the earth, teeming
with the dead. And so back
to the flowers, which every spring 
since Dürer, and long before, 
have bloomed, discrete as the beloved, 
and if we are to believe Whitman, 
and why not, of the beloved as well, 
hair or tongue or the unseeing eyes 
that were the color of chestnuts 
and are no more. Why not lie 
in the grass in the sun, taking 
the flowers as proof that nothing dies. 
This is what the poems after, 
after all: a figure, no matter 
how thin, that might make 
these reversals in matter seem 
like a switch flipped on and off, 
off and on. A child playing 
day and night, dark and light.
A single life like that, or not at all. 
The blazoned body undone, stitch 
by stitch. And what on the other side. 
If in the bag the phone rings 
and goes unanswered: will she 
feel like that, calling from far away.
 
Today is Monday, and I am carbon free. 
I don't mean carbon free, I mean sweet land of liberty. 
I mean I'm reducing my carbon footprint 
As I walk fast past the freezing flowering on Broadway, 
The pear trees blowing off steam in white bloom 
Despite a sudden cold front chilling the warmth. 
I hear airplanes high-fiving and helicopters choppering. 
Fire engines bellow and ambulances going through a light go woo woo. 
It's an election year, and it's time to declare whom you're for. 
I'm for a fine Airedale named Hobbes
After the philosopher, the dog walker walking him explains
And I'm for all the other animals I greet on the sidewalk. 
Hobbes! I can tell you're a good boy! 
Hobbes pauses and looks up at someone 
He can tell understands him. 
A seven-year-old I'd never met came over to me 
At Grandparents Day at my grandson's school 
In Brooklyn, and started talking to me as if I were his. 
He said both his grandparents were dead. 
But don't you have four? 
He said his mother was in Paris. 
He said his father was buried at sea. 
He was Huck Finn, with a gap 
Between his two front teeth and in his story, who like Hobbes 
Seemed to know whom he was for. 
The trees in the center strip of Broadway not yet in bloom 
Stick up like antlers above the ones in flower. 
There is no excuse for not voting next November 
For the clouds or for the stars or the moon, 
And last night there was even a bright planet 
Next to the moon sliver when I came home drunk. 
The pigeons are cooing and moaning and mating 
To my disgust down here on earth this Monday. 
Today is Monday, and in Florida and endlessly 
An unarmed black kid seventeen years old has been shot dead 
By a neighborhood watchman, a Latino gentleman. 
At a break in the forest, he saw a wide lake 
frozen white and silent like some distant palazzo. 
Nothing but dark necks rising from it. 
A hundred black horses, heads studding the surface. 
Through the ice he couldn't see their bodies. 
As if the cold had taken those completely. 
The total stillness. Then the wind, lifting one mane. 
Near the lake's edge, some few were caught 
where they had risen horribly on the backs 
of one another, trying to touch land. Each eye 
open wide and stricken with terror. 
Now, only the sound of the wind. Their shadows 
doubling each darkness onto the ice. 
as if         you were ever wide-eyed enough to believe in urban legends

as if         inner and outer were merely phases of the same substance
as if         this whiteness had been your original condition
as if         it hadnt been what was piped into you, what suffused each vacant 
                cell, each airhole, each pore
as if         you had started out skinless, shameless, blameless, creamy

If she had said, No, 
The world would not have stopped: 
Birds would have flown high still into sky, 
The heavens would have proclaimed his glory 
And the firmament the work of his hands. 
For what might break the grip that held my pen 
so fast I couldn't write another line 
I quested through the shops of Lady Charity 
in Urbs Leodiensis Mystica, 
the Shed Crew's capital of Ashtrayland, 
a town beyond the literary world 
whose locals speak blank verse (says Harrison); 
Back-to-Front Inside-Out Upside-Down Leeds, 
according to the Nuttgens book I bagged
along with others offering keys to open 
secrets of iambic pentameter, 
to them, a ball and chain, a waltzor best, 
in Zizek's windsock for the New World Order, 
Gnostic code imprinted by five feet 
that lead us to a grail Brown liquefies, 
as Shakespeare sometimes turns this line himself 
to deliquescent decasyllabics 
like the blood of St Januarius. 
Brown quotes from Philip's Gospel (where it suits) 
to build on Rosslyn Chapel's premises 
his castle perilously in the air 
while staying blind to mysteries below, 
such as why you'll see Rosslyn's masons carved 
among the seven virtues Greed, 
and then set Charity with deadly sins ... 
The world was made in error Philip wrote
(Savonarola, in The Rule of Four, 
another blockbuster from Oxfam's shelves 
that followed in the footprints of Dan Brown, 
is made to quote 'the Gospel of St Paul' ... 
is this the fault of slipshod editing 
or does it hint perhaps at secret truth? 
What if 'Paul's Gospel' really did exist? 
What if it was some long-lost Gnostic text 
thrown on the Bonfire of the Vanities 
but glimpsed once by our zealot's burning eyes 
who then confided to the ancestors 
of those that seemed just greedy novelists 
a hidden road map to the Holy Grail 
a blind man saw on his Damascus road? 
I have become handsome in my old age. 
"You're cute," smiled Denise, breaking up with me, 
"But cute is all you'll ever be." 
Denise who was so wrongwrongwrong, I miss 
Our Woodstock nights, half-a-million thumb-flicked 
Bics coaxed to climax by God's thwapping bass, 
Hissing soppy Oms against the cloudmass. 
A drenched, naked hillside soulless and pure, 
Zonked, mud-caked, Yanomamö, immature. 
I forgive Sly and the Family Stone. 
I slept through Santana, dreaming future 
Exes who might love me despite my rage. 
I have grown lonesome in my afflictions. 
The small box is filled with little beasts
a barn that's a barge, a boatthe ark's 
ridged sides like boards, a plastic plank, 
a deck that drops in fitted slots, but lifted 
reveals that zoo of twosheaped beasts 
to be released beneath a glittering tree, 
its dove-clipped limbs. Dad's asleep 
in his reclining seat, and crumpled waves 
A Castlerahan Nativity
    i.m. Michael Kavanagh 
It became 
in the field 
where he lay 
as helpless 
as a baby 
a kind 
of nativity 
as the cows 
he loved 
and knew 
by name, 
and that 
loved him, 
placed 
between 
the world's cold 
and him 
their bodies. 
 
 
Pig Sty, Janeville
Stone-walled, slated, pitched, this tiny house 
swept out, its occupants devoured, 
calls to mind that flat country 
beyond Cahorsplatoons of sunflowers 
hanging their black heads in the weeks 
of the vendange; and me, 
sleepless under the same roof as the sow 
that dozed on the far side of a wall 
Harvey says it'll hold for now meaning the gasket
he's rigged to stop the leak in the water tank 
it's what he says when he conjures a grasp of wood 
notched to catch a door that always swung shut his supply 
of couplers and pipe makes visible the makeshift 
nature of our daily operations the contingencies 
he concocts from the hardware store of his truck to hold 
for now electrical and structural salvations he believes
in the temporal the neighborly the seasonal the salvaging 
of all re-usable metal and wood in the inevitable 
breakdowns coming towards us about which he chuckles 
installs a stop valve and tightens the joint by hand 
knowing a system undergoing a thermodynamic process 
can never completely return to its previous state 
and a leaky valve in faucet or heart requires mechanical 
gods who say wiping their hands it'll hold for now 
In spring wild horses ascend 
through mullein and sedge 
to rub noses with the mount 
of the worn-away saint and stamp 
hooves at the figure cringing 
underneath. Deer come too 
and knock antlers on spandrels, 
remembering the miracle of 
their milk. Swallows swoop 
and snuggle in the gaping 
eyes of saints above the root-
wrecked floor. Winter-weary, 
wheat stands watch with canny 
grace and branches tug shy walls 
to skirts against the chorus of rain. 
Loose rocks fall and fling a note 
trembling down the aisle where 
the apse strokes its grassy beard 
as if recalling a long-lost troparion. 
Vines tick through generations 
of resurrections as bellflowers 
When I had died and stood nowhere, 
outside of moments, gathered 
beside myself, undoing, 
vanishing into undone, 
I was surprised. I always believed 
there would be one more thing. One moment 
had always followed on another, 
always something corning after. 
I searched in what remained of memory for images. 
Already the swirl was scattering what I knew. 
Like ash, like leaves, like birds released. 
Already people and places mingling 
equally, remembered and imagined. 
My first lover, a patch of weeds behind a shed, 
the low sun firing the branches of trees beside the pond. 
There were other visions, too, partial and brief, 
which seemed to belong to other lives not mine, 
the whirlwind erasing distinctions. 
Only one thing stood clear. I saw my great white dog 
who walked with me nine years on wooded paths, 
years when I was so lonely 
only his silence could comfort me. 
I saw him up ahead on the trail packed hard with snow. 
He was nosing at a stump, getting news. 
Even then he never walked beside me, but circled 
out and back, allowing me the gravity 
of a moving center. When he died he left an emptiness 
carved into air. The silence of his being 
could not be gathered up. He simply was no more. 
is not that I am half her and half 
my father, quite, so it's not true 
that I am destined to half of her 
battalion of doctors
or exactly half her body's refusal 
to go through this world assembled 
in a way anyone understands. My brothers 
don't question this, that they are separate 
as moons. They don't look 
like her. They orbit, tall, black-haired. They reach, 
lift things down from the top cupboards. 
Me, though. Who am I but her 
creation, clicking around in all her old 
high heels? Listen, who knows 
where this comes from. And you, you, 
must've inherited your brain 
from your father. But I have her arm 
in mine so she won't stumble because 
that's what the medicine does, undoes 
the balance calibrators. I hold tight. I am careful, 
as we walk, to watch where she puts her feet 
A backbone 
Is more useful 
Than a wishbone 
A martyr's halo 
Is sometimes a noose 
Looks so poor 
Even the flies stay away 
A protruding chin 
Gets there first 
If your only tool 
Is a hammer 
Everything gets a pounding 
Wets his lips 
Before a dry speech 
The rooster 
Needs no winding 
The final side dish 
The bill on 
A black plastic plate 
The thief sleeps 
In running position 
Love can go around corners 
You stop growing 
At fifteen 
Time for platform shoes 
Rolls up a newspaper 
To kill a fly 
Ends up reading the headlines 
His beard 
A hedge 
His tongue 
A talking bird 
Thunderbolt 
Like a chrome bumper 
Falling from the sky 
Hit a tall guy 
He sways like a tree 
Hit a squat guy 
He moves one inch 
Like a boulder 
A wobbly pup 
Stirs our hearts 
Tacos 
Like meat purses 
With lettuce hanging out 
A car with different 
Colored fenders 
Poor guy's restoration 
You can start 
On either end 
Of a hotdog 
Rotate your hamburger 
See where to begin 
Flies have replacements 
Chipping away 
You find a heart 
Inside a stone 
Can't spell 
Slur your penmanship 
Shrimp boy 
In childhood 
Whale man 
In adulthood 
Crying baby 
Almost like a monster 
Puts on his T-shirt backwards 
That's how he does things 
A small electric car 
Just a toaster 
On wheels 
Polite 
A biscuit takes off its hat 
Leaderless 
Cockroaches scatter 
When the cellar light goes on 
Bull in a china shop 
Just browsing 
Rich family 
Poor family 
For the dog 
All the same 
Climate change 
Summer now part of autumn 
Nothing 
Took the backseat 
To something 
A spiteful mouth 
A cave with chisels 
A ladle 
The mother of all spoons 
Stubborn evening dying 
Keeps his eyes open 
Ladders 
The envy of stepstools 
A clever squirrel 
Rolls the apple home 
In bed 
Lovers 
Not in bed 
Spouses 
Big feet in a small shoe 
The toes squished all in a row 
Can't be pornography 
If both hands 
Are on the book 
A bike built 
With stolen parts 
Never rides straight 
Burger patties on the grill 
Hissing at customers 
Loan him twenty 
Next week it's fifty 
The middle son 
Takes the beating 
Monthly deductions 
From your paycheck 
Government thievery 
A good joke 
But not over and over 
Down at the water
      glancing through 
a web of fingers
a mirrored face, 
      veering blues, 
a cirrus. And my father 
underwater roving 
      bottom-stones 
I'd dreamt of tapping 
in one long-held 
      breath. Kneeling 
at the dock's edge, 
I watched him scour 
      silt and lichen, 
flash of a play-thing, 
as I settled on 
      the sob's octave. 
Earlier, by the spider's 
silk on the swim 
      ladder, I'd seen 
under the dock 
into the colony of cool 
      rot, and through 
to the warped world 
a well will pull in, 
      to what monsters 
dwell in bodies 
of water. I'd seen 
      fall thinning 
the flocks, a chain 
of ripples shuddering 
      under an osprey's 
dripping talons. 
And at home, 
      the stove-fire, 
the three-story absence. 
Kneeling at the dock's 
      edge, snagged, 
I fixed my gaze 
on the bay's boony 
      depths where my father, 
feeling along the pitch- 
black of centuries-old 
      soaked larch, 
followed my taut line 
straight to the shimmer 
      snared in bark. 
Root-moored, 
he picked at each 
      hook of the lure, 
a solemn, meticulous 
sifting as if he were 
      parting skin 
for a splinter in my palm. 
This body,
                  brute 
fact, given thing 
that winces sometimes 
from the mere jolt of itself (joints thickening, 
stiff gristle, nerve-ends bared) 
against itself... This one, 
the scorch in the veins 
from inside like the moment 
before fire takes, an agitating smoulder in the tinder, 
out into the tightest far capillaries. 
See it sensing itself 
remote and close, 
as an infrared scanner might spy 
through roofs, to find... do I mean me? in hiding 
or through earthquake-jumbled walls 
as the rescue teams call, listen, 
call. See our two (do we even 
own them?) bodies sense each other, 
waking in the dark; each would know if the other was gone. 
We give out presence, 
weather, transpiration. Life 
is work and work 
is heat, the one 
sheer gift; we hold it here between us, just to spend 
on, subcontractors to the sun. 
 
A Love Song of Carbon
For six years, on a high shelf in an upstairs bedroom, 
        she was the only one who did not change. 
Down here, in the oxygen economy, we came and went, 
        our carbon still mixed with water, breathing, moistening, 
                dryingyes, even our youngest, there, etching in breath 
on the glass, now a smiley or down-in-the-mouth-now 
        moon-face dripping. He took time, the eldest, withering 
without her, needing ointments for his thinned 
        and flaking skinthe sores on his shin did the weeping, 
                the chemical bonds coming loose, letting parts of him go ... 
As patient as she'd learned to be in life, she 
        waited, dressed and containedin leather-textured 
cardboard round a screw-top urn. Six years till the day 
        they could meet in all simplicity, at last, entirely 
                conversant with each other. Ash into ash 
lifts from my broadcast scatter, and into a wet wind 
        for winnowing, chalkier flakes dropping free 
into wire-rooted ling, small gorse, bell heather, 
        rabbit scuts; the finer grains fetched up (we 
                flinch, then stay, yes, why not let them dust us) 
lifting towards Sheepstor, North Hessary Tor, 
        Great Mis Tor and the deeper moor beyond 
whatever skyline he and she had ever reached. 
        The rain clouds come up over Cornwall like the grey 
                Atlantic. Generations. Wave on wave on wave. 
One of the Evenings
After so many years, we know them. 
This is one of the older Evenings: its patience, 
settling in, its warmth that needs nothing in return. 
So many Augusts sitting out through sunset, 
first a dimness in the undergrowth like smoke, 
and then like someone you hadn't noticed 
has been watching a long time... 
It has seen everything that can be done in the dark. 
It has seen two rifles swing around 
to train on each other, it has seen lovers meet and revolve, 
it has seen the wounds grayscale in low light. 
It has come equally for those who prayed for it 
and those who switched on lamp after lamp 
until they could not see. It deals evenhandedly 
with the one skimming the stairs as rapidly as typing, 
the one washing plates a little too loudly, 
the one who thinks there is something more important, 
since it does not believe in protagonists, 
since it knows anyone could be anyone else. 
It has heard what they said aloud to the moon, to the stars 
and what they could not say, 
walking alone and together. It has gotten over 
I cannot live through this, it has gotten over This did not have to happen 
and This is experience one day I will be glad for. 
It has gotten over How even for a moment 
could I have forgotten? though it never forgets, 
leaves nothing behind, does not believe in stories, 
since nothing is over, only beginning somewhere else. 
It could be anywhere but it is here 
with the kids who play softball endlessly not keeping score, 
though it's getting late, way too late, 
holding their drives in the air like invisible moons a little longer, 
giving way before them so they feel like they're running faster. 
It likes trees, I think. It likes summer. It seems comfortable with us, 
though it is here to help us be less ourselves. 
It thinks of its darkening as listening harder and harder. 
 
Essay on Clouds
Maybe a whale, as Hamlet mused, 
or a camel or weasel, 
more likely a hill, still likelier 
a school of hills, since (as with us) 
true singletons are rare. 
We compare them mostly 
to silent things, sensing 
that thunder is something else 
that gets into thema stone, a god 
and as for what they want to say, 
aeromancy, which presumed to interpret, 
never caught on. After all, 
clouds weren't reliable predictors 
even of rain, and if they had a message 
for us, we guessed, 
it would hardly be practical: 
clouds are not about 
about, showing instead 
boundless detail without specificity. 
Whales, sure (which might in turn be 
blue clouds), but we don't say 
How very like a screwdriver, 
or my house, or my uncle, or certainly 
how unlike my uncle. For though a blend 
of winds we don't at our level 
necessarily feel lends them 
amazing motion, that's not the same as 
intention, so failure 
is not in question. We wouldn't say 
That cloud is derivative, jejune, 
disproportionate, strained, misplaced 
or (since they affirm nothing) 
That cloud is wrong, 
though truly they often bear down 
on exactly the wrong momentthat overcast, 
is it one cloud or ten thousand 
that makes everything feel so gray 
forever? From inside, of coursethink 
of flying through one
a cloud has no shape. As with us: only 
when someone looks hard, or we catch 
our reflections, do we solidify as 
whale 
weasel 
fool
and plummet. Though large clouds weigh 
more than a 747, not one 
has ever crashed, so admirably 
do they spread their weight, a gift 
it is not too much to hope 
we could possess, since according to Porchia 
we are clouds: If I were stone 
and not cloud, my thoughts, 
which are wind, would abandon me. O 
miracle not miraculous! Everything 
we know well 
lightens and escapes us, and isn't that 
when we escape? So just as 
Old and Middle English clúd 
meant rock or hill, but now 
means cloud, really I mean
in exactly the same way that stone 
got over being stone 
You know the sortthe postcard that gets stuck 
between the ads for siding and the plea 
for missing children, that you usually 
toss out, another scrap for the garbage truck. 
But, to your own surprise, one day you pluck 
the yellow flyer out and go, and he 
and you first meet, which just as easily 
might not have happened, a simple case of luck:

everything resting on a thing so small, 
In mathematics they say the most beautiful solution is the correct one

In jurisprudence they say there is no justice 
In philosophy they say there is no truth 
In literary studies they say everybody come along be ironic now

Have we? says another. We, if we're the right we, are 
the people. We can be we everyone, in the right thought. 
We found our own true love when we were young, but we 
didn't know why we had to do this. Hadn't we 
always? And now, we don't know. Everything we 
have done we can come to despise: dividing us into 
the we of men and the we of women for example; and all 
the other we the peoples we, the largest we, are composed of. 
Can we truly be this most large we of all, all the people? 
We are domestic and malicious, we are kind and empty, 
we are purely stupid, sadistic, mortal, but if that, as 
we replace us with ever more of us, we will never die. 
I might like to die someday, someone says. I'm not sure 
that I don't mind if we die. For I'm not sure what 
living is, in that way that we always seem to be sure. 
We who ever manipulate what we think, we kids. 
We loved our mother and our father, for they watched us play 
without interruption, across the long afternoon and into evening. 
Then we lost each other to our new families, our most 
desired we, we thought; why do we want now to find each 
other again, the we of our beginning? Who do we trust the most, 
as we cleave and uncleave and cleave again into successive 
groups, small and large, in a time we define as us, our 
history? Our time is only us. Time the substantial we, 
epochal and great, as only we can see it, our particulars. 
In the historical library, one reads our book. Don't 
you want to know what's real? Don't you want to worship our 
pitiless exclusion of the times we don't know, can't remember? 
We found our shores walking across a shallow ocean 
or rowing in boats. Or we just materialized alongside 
the people we are most like who aren't peoplemaybe 
they're people. Maybe the apes are people. And the birds, 
lizards, and lilies, we say; fish and algae, the sweet other 
mammals, the dear ones, the spiders and frogs. We the people, 
who appeared before we were born, for some of us were always 
there. We found us from before, but there was a long, raucous 
before; and some of us are sad we can't remember it. We 
have stories to complete, as in our long integrity, though 
they aren't true. We aren't true, defining ourselves as 
mammals with digits and brains attesting to our superiority 
over other parts of our we, but there is no superiority 
without our we, without all of us. Without us we are nothing. 
Without delicate, exhalant flora we are nothing; without 
mists, and stars and planets, and the creatures who live in our 
bodies. We are all of us congealed into our definition of we. 
We go where we livethere is nowhere else. We make 
ourselves hats and gendered pants and skirts. We are sure 
we are correct in our details; we are of our times, our 
class, and our values, correct as only we know how; 
and our machines excite us, so much that we consider 
them us: we want them to think and act as us. We 
are our body of the airplane, the computer, and the car. 
We are our canon and our rebellion, but that is more 
of the story we have invented that is urgent, appropriate, 
and true. We are our songs and films. We are what some of us 
say, that more of us choose. How could we love each other 
without knowing how from our resemblant forms, our 
echoing sounds? We can identify ourselves from our pastimes. 
And our loves. For aren't we our loves, above all? We 
hate the ones who are spontaneously different, as if 
what they loved accused us of unhappiness. We divide 
then; we don't know which of us are really our ethic or element. 
Rain works the road; 
its grey hand passing over and over, in waves: lashing, 
stotting down. A stour-wind's in the trees, 
churning their heads, and the sky's 
full of leaves and the sky is raging: 
it will not subside 
and will not cease, 
and will not be consoled. 
As thunder brings the toads so 
rain draws worms from the ground, the rapt god 
to this bedroom window, this house 
of panic, of closed mouths, 
a bird trapped in every room. 
Listen to me. 
The man who lies beside you's not the man I used to be. 
I think the wind is easing—
I take that as a sign from the other world 
until I remember the other world has abandoned me.
Listen. I will tell you both. 
No birds fly over Coille nan Easgann, 
the sacrificial wood; no animals stray there, 
only the insects and worms can make use of it. 
The first was that daftie, Doogie McRae: 
moon-struck, wanting a feather in the wing. 
I found him hunkered in the ruined church; 
dust round his mouth, from eating moths again. 
As we reached the wood, the dusk was drawing in, 
erasing every tree, and he was pleading, 
offering a piece of chalk, a white marble—
he held out a hawk's tail like a hand of cards. 
I took him to the black burn, under the snags, 
and hung him by his feet over the dark water 
and fed his face to the eels. 
I told Mary Greig about the deer-couch in the wood 
where they slept—that I had a half of whisky; 
she fell for it all: the flattened bracken, 
the fresh fallow droppings like liquorice. 
She was full rank by the bottle's end 
and I had to disorder her, trying 
to get my fingers in her purse, and she wanted it 
well enough I could tell, so I riddled her through 
and shot my roe—and left her 
in her peltry of jellies and syrups 
with a smile that went right round her head. 
That long cullion, Sandy Gallivaster, 
wanted a go at Mary 
so I took him to the wood and showed him. 
She didn't look so good now, and then 
suddenly neither did he, when I smacked him 
with a rock and then cut him to collops, 
made force-meat of his stupid legs, 
hard-gralloched him and glibbed him, and pinned 
his stones on a blackthorn bush for remembrance. 
on the floor of our house, early morning 
make me immeasurably happy 
the slight chill counterbalancing the heat 
of coffee spreading through the brain. 
Nothing, I think, could make me happier 
exceptmy bare feet 
on the tight-wove wool pile of our faux-antique 
Persian rug, or my hands on this bowl 
or this bowl 
or this one, 
or my lips on your lips, soft 
as air rushing out of the oven, 
or my fingertips 
across the oven's white enamel, 
its one nick. 
I count the seconds, click by weighted click,
As though they were the tumblers to a safe
          I meant, in time, to crack,
Knowing that if it took a hundred years
Of nimble-fingered tuning and retuning
          And a musicians ears
To learn the arta lifetime spent in straining
To hear that moment when the moment catches
          It would be worth the training
of his 15th generation Spanish heritage held on tracts of land he had 
claim to in New Mexico or Spain. I don't remember which. 
When I tell him my parents never taught me Spanish, he instructs me 
with the condescending click of a tongue to learn. 
His tone enough to redden my face like a slap he would have obliged 
when I already implicate myself enough in the form 
of awkward conjugations and the repeated phrase "¿Cómo se dice .. .?" 
Thinking about it now, this man showed me 
how we can associate ourselves with one side 
and deny the conquered half. I wish I could ask him now 
if he knows how we can forgive 
the culmination in our struggle through words and idiomas.
 
I look into their eyes by staring in the mirror and witness 
the wounds of younger days I regret collecting. 
When I was fourteen and asked if we had Indian blood inside, 
my mother's point blank answer, "No." Even then, I didn't believe, 
angry she didn't understand why it mattered to recognize 
two bloods swirled together while I didn't consider how 
concealing the indigena protected her growing up in Ecuador. 
To forget the native within, to smother origins in denial, 
are adopted habits 
from times before I knew how to track a pen into words. 
I think about my confusion burying me on a line 
drawn in the sand, knowing it will be erased 
by the rising tide, and then I turn again 
There was a plot to keep Anne in Dublin.
Five ex-boyfriends, myself the driving force,
met up for drinks and fed each others need
to pin her down this time and make her see.
County Sligo, wed heard, was in her mind.
And none would underestimate the draw.
Sligo, with those wide, butter-armoured dunes,
those copper-brained, summer-defying lakes,
where nature waives self meteorologically
and Donegal eagles mark Nordic time
all this mirrored Annes personality.
We drank her health and cursed her dream of peace.
But our sad friendships were subjective prey
to the drug of being Annes man once again.
And so it came to nothing, except this:
she left us, Sligo won, she farms there now.
Mother first, now my wife. 
Dead within a year. 
A joke unfunny life 
has foisted on me here. 
Past sixty, orphanhood 
can't be unexpected. 
It came: I understood. 
Grief was calm, collected. 
But that just months ahead 
there would be a second 
farewell to be said 
that I had not reckoned. 
One, two: each blow hit home. 
Each left the house more quiet. 
Each time, the patient loam 
obtained some profit by it. 
The orchestra has stopped. 
But faintly, unabating 
though the baton has dropped, 
two notes go on vibrating. 
One, two: insistent pair 
clinging to every thought. 
Murmured to vacant air, 
"One, two" adds up to nought. 
One, two: my footsteps roam 
from empty street to street. 
Some tireless metronome 
sets the relentless beat. 
One, two: the pace I keep 
requires no grace of art. 
Whether I wake or sleep, 
despoiled again, my heart 
"Brush your fingers 
through your hair, 
why don't you," her mother 
had just told her, & Bud Powell too 
advised that 
had you a wish to play the piano 
scout style, you should keep 
your fingernails 
clipped, hands 
as agile 
as cat's ears, swiveling, 
but this girl, a very tall 
mess-hall of a girl even without her bike helmet 
(and with it, a skinny, bitstream 
Valkyrie holding 
a cup of takeout green tea), 
out of her accumulated wisdom, 
splurging, she 
fairly brimmed with a lifetime's worth 
of patience 
distilled, not an ounce of annoyance
in her as she ignored 
her mothershe 
might as well have worn 
noise-cancelling headphones in honor 
of the serene smile 
on her lips
It was a year to the day that she bathed and started 
the long division, following it back along the creek 
outside his window, then down a gravel road 
to the coastal highway. 
                                    And here came an eighteen-wheeler's 
horn again     the brakes     her driving like crazy to find him 
her son.  Her almost late-phenomena she spotted   alive and 
standing in a filthy doorway.  Her womb.       His eyes 
on hers, and it struck       how she'd not checked on him
since childhoodabsent        from his cells' dark busyness. 
Every morning the body to be washed and food for bodies 
to be prepared, a plate before the clean body, 
body properly rinsed in water 
running out of some aquifer rushing over the shoulders 
and neck of the body in its shower. 
Now the coffee with its sharp smell like burnt soil 
and the pale, smoky egg smell like insides 
cooking, wafting through the house with its layer of dust 
in every corner, clothes letting go their infinitesimal 
threads every day 
like the skin of the body sloughing off every hour, falling 
like snow into the tiles 
so that should we disappear the dogs could still find us 
by that trail. Here we were in the kitchen. Here we sat. 
Once out the front door. Here in the car. 
When my oldest 
was a little girl another girl her age disappeared and back 
then I followed the case more or less closely 
in the way you do a famous woman pregnant the same time 
not serious 
just something to while away the time 
until the babies come and sweep you along in their river 
of sleep and milk and yellow diapers and tiny umbilical 
stumps that let you know they have come from somewhere 
else, from inside you, 
which is like coming from the sun, so bright and miraculous 
but also making perfect sense in the medical textbook way, 
there you were big as any 
thing walking 
pulling the unformed creature along 
letting it bounce in the bone bowl of the pelvis. When the old 
nurse took the babies from their clear plastic cribs and rinsed 
them you could see in the way she held their tiny necks 
she knew what she was doing. 
Not one slipped. Not one was lost to the whoopsie-daisy, 
that you were exactly as ardent as I and as novice 
that you had to ask only once but did ask 
          and did not speak of it after to others 
that it was an eclogue and an orchard dialogue 
with apples and talking and tears 
          and we did not know but learned to know 
and learned to know without fear     that you 
learned with me     going slow 
          and took nothing     but only gave 
and received     without shame     in slant light 
in the fall     your hands framing my face 
          and you kissing me     open-eyed 
In the open where any bluebird can see them, 
but the beetles don't care: six couples, 
tripping on amino acid, have converted 
my tomato plant into Plato's Retreat. 
Each pair has booked a leaf close enough to spy 
on the others, compare techniques. Six 
rainbowed backs, six tops and six bottoms, 
swimming through glue. One feeler shimmies 
out as I pass, a swinger's salute to the chief. 
He can't hoist either hand above his head. 
Her feet won't stand more than a dozen steps. 
He's too nearsighted for the DMV. 
Her fingers feel like she's got mittens on. 
When did his legs get too long for his arms? 
When did her arms get too short for her eyes? 
He can't smell newsprint pressed against his nose. 
She can't hear Thanks while helping with his socks. 
The kitchen bulb burns out for both and each. 
She sits in her tufted chair 
by the open window where, 
nine stories below, the creek 
burst its banks two years ago 
and drowned, with amazing speed, 
a young couple unprepared 
for disasters of any 
magnitude. A shiny cane 
rests by her side; she leans her 
chin on her hand as she skims 
the poems, pausing when an 
image strikes her, or a word. 
Expressions travel across 
her face; her papery skin 
rustles as leaves are disturbed 
by breezesor gusts of rain. 
A frown (of concentration? 
disapproval?) melts away, 
or turns fearful. Was I wrong 
to show them to her? I thought 
it was safe. She has a gay 
friend from Austin; she irons 
his shirts; he teaches her to 
text and tweet, gives her a high 
five before he drives off in 
his battered Mustang, tells her 
'sweet' when she gets something right. 
Lamplight casts her doubts in low 
relief. She looks up, smiles, says, 
'All those rhymes! I hadn't thought 
there would be so many.' Then 
we move to safer topics: 
Some regrets take the air, 
almost visibly, bright 
against the mind's wide sky. 
The child you never had, 
for some reason red-haired. 
The way you said goodbye 
to your first real girlfriend. 
The boy, the bicycle, 
the stop sign you ignored. 
Staying on vacation 
despite your father's stroke, 
your mother's failing heart. 
Chips on red and not black. 
The phone call you refused 
to pick up from your friend 
stopped on a bridge, car door 
flung open. Deleting 
his voicemail. Not even 
listening. They're out there 
somewhere, qualms, misgivings, 
just waiting to be launched 
the way those pigeons did 
when I went skeet shooting 
with David, who saved me, 
to whom I've not spoken 
in a decade. Regrets 
I want to blow to bits, 
like those Day-Glo disks 
The Clearing
What does God want 
with so many stars 
and black holes 
in infinite space? 
What is God's plan 
on rainy nights 
when the wind blows 
and topples the flowers? 
In this dark empire 
the gift of uncertainty 
follows me through the forest. 
Maybe I dreamed 
the clearing 
I saw in the trees. 
 
Christ in São Paulo 
Still stricken by your glyph, I flip 
the card (the Magi, on the verso, 
are engaged in conversation), rehearse, 
again, as they must, the significance 
of their gifts, passing the long hours 
of their journey: gold, and frankincense, and myrrh, 
and gold, and frankincense, and myrrh, and gold ... 
I'm going to flicker for a moment 
and tell you the tale of a shadow 
        that falls at dusk 
                out of the blue to the earth 
                and turns left along the path to here 
                groggily under its black-out 
                being dragged along crippled over things as if broken-winged 
not yet continuous 
no more than a shiver of something 
with the flesh parachute of a human opening above it 
but lengthening a little as it descends through the rings 
of one hour into the next 
                with the rooks flying upwards snipping at the clouds 
until at last out of that opening here it lies 
my own impersonal pronoun 
crumpled under me like a dead body 
it is faint 
it has been falling for a long time 
look when I walk 
it's like a pair of scissors thrown at me by the sun 
so that now as if my skin were not quite tucked in 
        I am cold cold 
trying to slide myself out of my own shade 
but hour by hour more shade leaks out 
        or if I stand 
                if I move one hand 
        I hear the hiss of flowers closing their eyelids 
        and the trees 
as if dust was being beaten from a rug 
                shake out their birds and in again 
it's as if I've interrupted something 
that was falling in a straight line from the eye of God 
The bird is in the center of the sun. 
Its outline is silent, 
as its nude, smooth wings extend 
across the sphere of light. 
They almost block it.

With large red lips, 
a ceramic fish face 
in a pink knit pouch 
from which spinelike 
sticks protrude 
is suspended 
above the work station.

Inside this lidded sky 
on the dining-room table, 
above a fistful 
of grass and leaves, one rock, 
a katydid hugs the slant 
of a dropped-in stick, 
plucked from its part 
in the afternoon's chorus, still 
The truth you heard is wrong, is happy-hung 
absurd inside your dumb and rusty heart, 
love-sick and goat-jaw at the seams, wet tongue 
of God a quick surprise of stop and start 
and does-not-care, and if inside the breath 
on which you fall asleep a prayer abides 
within your chest, the crusty shibboleth 
of violent ends, of trust in smallish lies, 
perhaps you start to doubt the stumbled halls 
of dreams that render in dissolve, in mise 
en scène of box inside of box, so small 
and so serene. So, then, the lie: a tree, 
He never saw a violin. 
But he saw a lifetime of violence. 
This is not to presume 
That if he had simply seen 
A violin he would have seen 
Less violence. Or that living among 
Violins, as though they were 
Boulangeries or toppling stacks 
Of other glazed goods like young adult 
Fiction, would have made the violence 
Less crack and more cocaine, 
Less of course and more why god oh why. 
More of one thing 
Doesn't rhyme with one thing. 
A swill of stars doesn't rhyme 
With star. A posse of poets doesn't rhyme 
With poet. We are all in prison. 
This is the brutal lesson of the 21st century, 
Swilled like a sour stone 
Through the vein of the beast 
Who watches you while you eat; 
Our eternal host, the chummed fiddler, 
The king, James I, held up well. Not so 
the Pilgrim whose vinyl face has split. 
His mice-gnawed legs, still wearing blue knee breeches, 
are bent in a motionless jig. They are going 
cheap, these wax-museum figures, former stars 
of dioramas depicting the Plymouth story. 
I knew them. Posed 
among plastic turkeys and artificial snow, they guided me 
to an honest childhood fascination 
with early America. Now, at the parking-lot sale, 
the Wampanoag man dressed in buckskins 
gazes past traffic. He's disenchanted. 
My old thinking embarrasses me. Those Pilgrims
their purposeful gardens failing, their forest fear, 
their exertions of biblical faithmoved me. 
I didn't noticeone Pilgrim face was modeled 
on Elizabeth Taylor, another on Ringo Starr
yet I sensed their glamour. In starvation, despair, 
they stayed handsome. History became them. 
I am starting to understand being outdated. 
You smile harder. You realize you've taken a pose 
you can't get out of. History moves past you. 
Certain decommissioned Pilgrims 
are headed to Halloween haunted houses. Others, 
too dilapidated, will spend their final hours as firewood. 
The king's in rags, the robe of his state unseamed 
                        Like a flimsy 
            Map over- and overfolded. 
Finally silent the squabble and scold, 
                        The family rabble 
            Undaughtered by dagger, 
By draught and a noose, and his poor fool hanged. 
                        Never heart 
            Had greater cause to quit. The quarto 
Stretches Lear upon the world's tough rack 
                        To sorrow's span 
            And then undoes the button 
Of his last breath. But the later draft 
                        Engrafts a father's 
            Fancy to his final: Look there, 
Look there, as if some lively twitch yet flickered 
                        Upon the lips 
            Of the ever-illegible girl. 
There at the verge of tragedy, say never, 
                        Griever, five 
            Times over like a fetish, 
A fervor of faith that the folio knows 
                        To deliver 
            The one unrecoverable blow. 
He angles the lever, strains his back, 
          pushes the stuck wagon, and slips 
                    in wet mud, stinking marl. 
Bluecoats with bayonets 
          drive them west, flank the spun-out line 
                    as he hums, strings together words, 
works out the notes. Carry me home. 
          Bluecoats catcall the Choctaw women. 
                    Brightest day. He boils boneset tea 
for his wife's fever. Her face is chapped, 
          her hands raw from tubs of lye. 
                    When gorge ice masses in the river, 
Unexpectedly this October afternoon, the telescope turns, 
I see myself, made small again, through its objective lens: 
I am not the widower, who recently buried my wife, 
Nor the dutiful son who kept vigil while my father, 
Like a punch-drunk boxer, fought to out-fox death, 
Demented and enraged, hands trapped in cartoon gloves 
To stop him pulling out the tube to his morphine pump. 
Today we clear the house where he lived for sixty years. 
In the bedroom where I was born, my siblings recall 
How, as children, their only clue to my birth occurring 
Behind this closed door were anxious instructions to pray. 
When we open up the attic we discover the suitcase 
My mother packed for her last trip into hospital: 
A wash-bag and talc, clothes she never got to wear home, 
A purse crammed with prayers and the folded letter 
I wrote, as a ten-year-old, for my sister to bring into her. 
I spend one page telling her how good I'm being, then cram 
Three pages with scrawled Xseach one to represent a kiss. 
Last week a granddaughter she never knew sang on stage, 
Luminous and radiant, in a band named Little Xs for Eyes. 
For four decades in a letter in a purse in a suitcase in this attic 
These galaxies of Xs were the banished eyes of a bewildered child. 
Butunfolding themI see myself stare out at who I am now, 
Across this life I could never have envisaged as I scrawled 
Untidy Xs for a woman I last saw smiling from a hospital bed, 
Who sealed them in her purse when nurses shaved her head 
In preparation for the operation she would never recover from: 
rain
if we stand in woods after rain when the trees are iron and purple, like wine, we'll wish we could staynot to wait for the woollen comfort of dusk, nor to hear the wind flinching back from the heart to let it be quiet and still ... but to stand in the iron and purple of evening, our stories behind us like toys we've forgotten or lost, till we enter at last that place in the heart (that place in the dark of the heart) where there's nothing, not even weather
 
 
Field Oak
the riddled bark 
the sap that seals the broken heart 
the staggered reach 
the secret passed from leaf to leaf 
the stalwart roots 
the tiny chalices of fruit 
the watercolours of the dusk 
the tried-and-tested triplets of a thrush 
 
 
So Beautiful it Must be True
One day a note flew up and landed in your heart. 
It settled in between the lisping chambers, 
singing to itself and wanting only 
to be left aloneno eavesdropping!
It tiptoed up and down your arteries 
leaving echoes in corners and a hum. 
Fearing it was gone, you wept until you felt 
a familiar pain like a bruise to the groin. 
No scent in winter, no sound except 
The crack of oak 
In the backyard's ice and wind, or a dog's bark 
Over the empty lawns, gunshot 
Of oblivion in summer's breast, and only 
A steel tang of water on the tongue, 
Nothing to see, and the touch of nothing 
On the frozen fingertips. 
Let me pray to the pale mother, Madonna 
Of deprivations, blessed 
Lady of the starving dark, for her promise of 
Primal blue, her downward look 
Where a serpent like the letter S 
Squirms to spell out 
A new season beneath her heel, 
As if this barren air 
Were sick and sleeping, but not dead, as if 
The skullwork of the snow 
Would someday sprout green irises 
From its bony socket. 
Concatenations of the rain, 
Thin lines that link the surly heavens 
To this earth, or a sun 
So Sicilian it makes the stones sweat 
And strong men stagger
I'll take the scobs and stubble of the field, 
The ugly run of mud 
Along the gutter pipes, and not deny 
The magpie's brag, 
The sparrow's shaken sensibility, 
Brother to all 
The yellow bugs in the young grass 
And the fat fly at my ear. 
I was once the tree you hammered shims into 
so you could climb me like a ladder. 
And I was the new strawberry, larvae white and hard, 
and the bleeding-heart bush dropping valentines over your acreage. 
I was the fox on whom you did not pull the trigger, the air trapped 
beneath the frozen creek, and the broken milkweed's white sap. 
I did my growing far from you, arrived 
late one summer, shirt like a tartan flag. 
Come over. I said. Get to know me. 
Slump-shouldered totem, ragged owl 
looking down with gusto 
from crisscrossed power lines, 
what ever happened to you? 
You took off, I guess, or maybe died, 
each breath a tighter fold inward 
until your essence dulled, 
and disappeared. A perfect end. 
Despite not being wound since 1864, 
            the Beverly Clock tells time with a diaphragm 
                        it keeps in an air-tight box; temperature changes 
move the mechanism enough to jar each tick- 
            tock into motion, turning warm winds into prayer 
                        posts and play hours, tea dates and bed offices. 
When the narrow morning lifts, a lonely motion 
            yokes me to these dips and draws so a prodigal's 
                        constancy can measure out midwinter midnights—
That fall after the baby was born 
my hair fell out, 
not like antlers or teeth, 
but dark streams of worry 
down my arms. 
The scrawny city tree 
in the sidewalk 
next to Carl's Jr.
I caught sight of it 
just as a wind 
whirled its leaves away. 
This is the new you, 
ready for winter and risk
The book is missing. Somewhere in the house, 
misshelved, or at the bottom of some pile, 
its columned pages keep their measurements, 
ingredients, oven times, and helpful hints 
beyond perusal in a fat, useless wad. 
The island kitchen counter lets me have 
my pick of sides to feel myself marooned on. 
I push ahead without a recipe, 
halving quantities of what I have 
somehow to make edible without 
the stir of appetite. 
                                We used to work 
together at it, each on a different side, 
she stirring, measuring, tasting, I 
chopping, dicing, mincing as required. 
Rocking the blade the way she showed me to, 
I freed from each raw thing a smell we liked: 
the garlic's earthy reek, the ginger's sting, 
the anise wisping up from celery leaves. 
Now I look at the counter's empty side 
and listen to the onion I hacked up 
sputtering angrily, intense but futile, 
faltering as its fund of hoarded tears 
dissolves in the hot oil that some hunks 
of meat will sear in next. It probably 
isn't quite right (like so much else these days) 
but it will do: I need to make it do. 
Excuse Me
"Excuse me," the roshi said, 
removing his earphone, 
"I was just listening to some honkyoku 
and thinking about a wandering monk I knew 
whose passion was collecting sounds 
on a Sony digital tape recorder. He played me 
raindrops, 
wind high in the Rockies, surging through aspens, 
the magnified sound 
of an ant climbing a rock wall. 
Such sounds! 
Boring, enlightening. 
But my favorite sound 
was of his voice, explaining 
the sound of hand-drawn curtains 
on an old curtain rod, 
metal scraping metal, very lightly." 
 
As Han-Shan Observed
Rich man, 
loan me the keys 
to your park. 
You can see that it wants me: 
gardenias smile 
and the branches of the yew trees 
tremble with hope as I walk by. 
On the day that I fit through the bars 
of your fence, 
fragments will find each other, 
ends will meet, 
grieving will release the bereaved. 
In spring the grizzled men 
say "yowzah" 
when they like the look 
of a passing girl. 
That will be the whole world with me: 
Yowzah! 
How did the ship get into the bottle? 
And that camel, the needle's eye? 
I don't intend to stay. 
Maybe I am traveling, like some secret ore, 
through the hard veins of a mountain, alone. 
And I'm in so deep that I see no door 
and no distance: nothing but a single core 
that draws in all things and changes them to stone. 
My neighbor stands on her back stoop, watches me stamp
on shovels, me sweat, me tug up trash trees in my yard.
This yard was all packed dirt, a crap-ass lack of grading.
One old syringe, a hundred broken bottles. She watches me
work. She loves to watch me work on my knees, digging, lifting,
flipping Goshen stone from pallets into pathways, raised
bed for the cherry, its silken iridescent bark. She sighs, Whew!
A lot of work! I smile the way that means shut the fuck up, get back
to, yes, a lot of work. When I finish settling flagstones, pat
their sun-warmed little backs, their gorgeous curves
a mica-gleaming weight from gate to barbecue, she brays
A path to nowhere!, a line I keep, use again and again. All
that work: a path to nowhere. A lush backyard: whats
the point? Poetry: a path to nowhere, outsiders not knowing
where we are. Here we are! I found us! On our paths, each
ambling along. Sometimes I cried, taught seven classes, cleaned
houses, painted them, waited tables, tended bar. Not true, not
really: I tended bar so badly, and for just a secondask Misty,
anyone. I made gorgeous garnishes, achingly slow cocktails.
A path to nowhere, those cocktails. Like poetry, they got so
much nothing done. A path, though, a way, a way forward:
a way to think through our lives. Our lives, what we want
The hiss of air brakes on trucks slowing down 
to turn into Key Highway, around the bend 
under the cannon that kept Baltimore in the Union, 
cinnamon and paprika sifting across the black harbor 
from pots that made spice in the McCormick's plant, 
sandwiches from Jack's Corned Beef in brown bags 
beside slices of fruit cake in January, the holiday 
a turn in the wheel with new fittings on packing units 
to make way for spring and Arabers with broken ponies. 
The mornings are old preachers who moonlight 
as bookies and sing about how the gold is in the hand 
of God, and God sings about the gold in the wrapping 
of the sun setting over West Side high rise projects 
to rise in China where Buddha is a chance, while 
sons of bookie preachers study a dead Bruce Lee, 
beat their hands on bean bags in basements to make 
palms of iron and break unbreakable barriers to rip 
apart myths that hold the sacred arks of blackness. 
Under the weight of wet snow 
a dead branch broke and fell, 
I remember, taking the hornets' 
tattered gray lantern down with it. 
What if I'd stood the branch 
upright in a drift and set the nest 
on fire, a moment's torchorange 
mark against the white white air, 
a flutter of ash and unburnt shreds 
of wasp paper afloat on the flames' 
reprieve of lift and lilt. What if 
I'd caught a torn bit? What word 
might I have written there? 
                      
The body whirs in secret, 
a mute hornet's hive: 
queen, drone, sting, and a single 
blister of hot red honey. 
Or is it honey? Dare I touch 
my tongue to that drop and taste? 
How else to speak the hive's fevered silence
which is to say, how to speak? 
                      
How to contain, to embodyor is it 
to dis-embody?the whirlwind 
of unvoiced desires, powers, counter-
desires, fierce love roiling up, 
rising, revving, reveling in 
storm-over-the-Michigan light, flashes 
nicking the polished sheen of the surface, 
and still keep still at the core, wick, theoretical 
axis, the scrolled calm this frenzy orbits? 
The mind in the midst must stay 
cool, undizzied, in order to choose 
this stroke not that, while surrounded by winds 
A hurricane knocked out our power once.
Those weeks I read by oil lamp, wrote till late,
and dreamed of Mary Wroth and Dickinson.
The smoke curled up and left a smear of soot.
     (Shed told me that the poets who are blocked
     are those who could not play as children: maimed.
     Too well I know, you cant turn back the clock;
     ergo, adulthood full of tricks and games:
     stiletto-skipping down Manhattans walks
     [no crack; no break no back]; encased in latex,
     that orchidaceous, rubbery bouquet;
     the glitter of the night street, glass in asphalt.)
Tonight the sky is black and pepper-crisp.
The moon has never seemed so spherical,
blood-orange or rufous grapefruit, which the eclipse
dissevers, slice by slice, methodical.
 
Striding the college halls, bouncing 
on the balls of his feet, his religious habit 
wilting from his shoulders, he declined 
his nouns with conviction, 
cited encyclicals from memory, 
and kept all his facts straight, 
from church history to the poetry he quoted. 
He recited Aquinas verbatim. 
When he inhaled a cigarette, it stayed inhaled. 
"Father, would you mind not smoking in class?" 
"This is my class, I'll smoke if I goddamned well please."
Drifting through the room like unfettered ganglia, 
he spoke edited prose all week without consulting 
a single note, corrected every doctrinal error, 
then retired to his office to read Homer in Greek 
and annotate the church fathers. 
How many of us left his class awed to silence, 
or dropped his class, "leaping," he liked to say, 
"like rats from a fucking sinking ship," 
the smoke roiling from his mouth to veil his head. 
He clipped his consonants and opponents. 
Evenings, he whistled out beyond the lake, 
filling the woods with his tune. 
In one homily he said that if it rained all the time, 
...
And when there was nothing left 
for her to do but die, 
I brought my mother home with me. 
I put her in the stone cabin 
by the vineyard, cabin of her X 
and now dead husband, my father, 
cabin he called The Fortress 
in those years his mother 
came to live there. Came to die. 
 
...
With the mediocre portraits 
of her three children 
hung at the foot of her bed, 
I tried to joke that she now 
was trapped into looking 
at our heads. And, trapped thusly, 
she did what nobody 
could have predicted: 
she developed a sense of humor. 
An emergency sense of humor. 
That dark room in which 
we finally spoke. 
 
...
Remember how you wouldn't give up 
your tonsils? All those years they floated 
in formaldehyde? She's sitting in bed 
with impeccable posture. Dots of blood 
speckle the back of her cotton nightgown. 
Her laugh now sounds like her mother's laugh
a high crooning. And I'm remembering Cheracol
the sticky bottle of red cough syrup, 
my sticky hands, the swelling vapor-love of codeine, 
Here at the edge of the sea, I captured you 
by the scruff of your neck while you were readying 
the arrows in your quiver to strike me down. 
I saw your floral crown, set on the sand. 
I gutted out your belly like a doll's 
and took a close look at your phony gears; 
and picking through your mess of golden pulleys, 
I found a secret trapdoor that said 'sex'. 
I held you, sad and tattered on the beach, 
and showed the sun, exposer of your exploits. 
A ring of panic-stricken sirens watched. 
My mother lives alone.
Her clothes dryer and her stove
have broken, but she refuses
to let me buy her new appliances.
She says someone could fix
the ones she already has
if they'd just take the time.
"Who's someone?" I say,
during our weekly call
and she pretends she doesn't hear.
She cooks her food
on an old hotplate, hangs her clothes
on the line to dry, and says she's fine.
"I'll make do," she says.
Her neighbors have moved
and now the house next door
belongs to a computer repair company.
She complains that some nights
there are shapes in her yard
and in the yard next door.
She can hear music
and sometimes laughter,
feet moving through leaves
on the embankment behind the house,
hands pushing branches aside.
"They can see me," she says.
"They watch me."
"Who do you think it is?" I say,
"Kids smoking dope?"
"Thieves," she says, "vandals."
She tells me she spends hours
every night
standing by the kitchen door
listening, waiting.
"Are you afraid?" I say.
"No," she says, "I'm not afraid,"
"You're sure?"
At night, after we talk, I lie awake
wondering if she's really afraid,
if something is out there
she should be afraid of.
I see her opening the back door,
staring into the dark that hides
the yard and the hillside.
I lie still in my bed, eyes open,
sweat on my face.
Her small house
is full of listening and watching,
hers and mine.
After some minutes, she brings over
a chair. It creaks
when she steps up on it.
Barely breathing, I watch her
as she unscrews the light bulb
in the kitchen,
the last light in the house.
As they were leaving the garden 
one of the angels bent down to them and whispered 
I am to give you this 
as you are leaving the garden 
I do not know what it is 
or what it is for 
what you will do with it 
you will not be able to keep it 
but you will not be able 
to keep anything 
yet they both reached at once 
for the present 
and when their hands met 
He was the last cowboy in Massachusetts, 
stabling the palomino in his mothers garage,
buying a saddlery on Route 3A
when no one in fifty miles listened to country.
He slouched through our childhood, 
driving a tractor-trailer to the front door,
tooling around for a week in our push-button Chevy, 
pedal to the floor to burn out the sin.
Later he bought a sand farm west of Tucson 
and lived in a menagerie of wounds.
His gray wheezing cat looked stuffed
a dog with a confidence problem, perhaps.
Note who's got to go 
today, don't fuss 
about the means, 
just go ahead behead, 
impale, starve, strappado, 
the assortment 
of choices enough 
to make a crown 
crow. They never 
loved me enough. 
It must be said: They 
were a disappointment. 
This boy this boy this boy walks 
into woods because 
a dog goes deepyou barely make out 
her dappled light. 
This wee boy, the Scots would say, so? 
Just rushing where the beloved went. 
A father's words fainter, a mother back there who 
sees, holds the little handheld, patiently 
world! meet this marvel of a boy 
darker, dark wavering beyond 
earshot still 
corner-of-an-eye distant 
sun in trees mostly shade, the dog rolling around 
as a dog will 
for joy, a blur, what the hell. A boy 
between, leaf in layers 
a breathing, his alone own 
breath away from, ahead, oh the gods as 
double whammy, the one called 
Further, the one called What a Life to Be Had. 
Delicious. Dangerous 
glorious ever after: keep going! ecstatic 
in that dim and just so great
Or a singing. Aren't they always singing? 
Their names too: Stop, Turn Back, 
Oh Thick of It Give Way, three 
Our life stories are scary and droll, 
Like masks children wear on Halloween 
As they go from door to door 
Holding the little ones by the hand 
In some neighborhood long torn down, 
Where people ate their dinners 
In angry silence or quarreling loudly, 
When there was a knock on the door, 
A soft knock a shy boy makes 
Dressed in a costume his mother made. 
This morning she breathes in smoke, 
watches how clouds flower 
rain. 
Around her, trees grow like bottles 
of whisky. 
The moon is a magnetic-north 
feather, 
shifting away 
from the glass. 
Now, 
waiting. 
The radio is on, the TV is on, words falling 
like leaves on the forest-floor 
snow, 
buses roaming outside like big cats, 
the neighbour 
shouts at his girlfriend, 
a door 
shuts. 
There is noise everywhere. Everywhere 
there is silence. 
Her eyes are rice-field terraces, 
suspended in water 
or smoke. 
Outside snow is tucked under 
snow-leopard 
fog. 
The ring 
The white otter 
dove into water 
purple with afternoon. 
A joy soundless 
save the tearing 
of a few weeds from the stream. 
He won't be back. 
But one morning 
after the moon 
the otter had returned. 
A resurrection 
deep in the hills, 
a secret act 
that would be an omen: 
he had to cleanse his body 
of evils, 
give himself to water 
after letting go of land. 
When we left the home 
it was summer 
and the otter liked to sunbathe. 
We were heading south 
to celebrate New Year's. 
It must've been early 
in the morning, 
and the otter 
waited to avoid being seen. 
He went white, 
entered the stream 
and its scent of ducks 
that were soundless too. 
She says so the aunt and uncle and cousins all look 
in unison ooooh their approval 
What a beautiful girl while we hunch 
on the veranda in jeans and baggy t-shirt not 
what she means by beauty hardly 
a girl our hair barber-cut 
five years our chest inside two sports bras flattened 
further by the fabric bandage we pin close 
around our torso adamant 
inside of awkward gesture-awkward awkward 
to speak dodging pronouns to visit to sleep 
on the lace-draped living room couch 
so visible to all avoiding 
awkward trips to the sea with cousins 
who act like nothing's changed only sitting 
beside yiayia when she says 
our name and pats the cushion deliberately 
draws our hand into her shaking ones and puts 
on us the same ring that engaged her 
to him at sixteen she says 
Starting now, I'll do everything 
                                                as if I were a god. 
I'll walk from a dark room 
                                         as a god walks from a dark room.
I'll speak to strangers 
                                  as a god speaks to strangers. 
When it's time to say something important 
I'll rise from my chair 
                                   as a god would 
            and speak in my 
                                       celestial certitudes. 
There will be no more 
                                    lap-sitting, 
            no more stories 
                                      about my days 
as a barback or a ferryman 
or a farrier. 
                   There will be fewer hours spent tuning 
my piano 
                and patting my hunting dogs 
or remembering 
                          my youth. When I need you to hurt 
I'll put you to sleep as a god puts you to sleep, 
I'll play my discordant harp as a god plays a harp, 
and the effects will be the same. 
The noise of the bramble 
                                       never leaves me. 
I bless the cedar. The months go by. I bless your saw. 
When you need 
                          me to hurt, I'll dim 
in the linden leaves, I'll hide 
                                          in the fire-scarred hills, 
and the great guards 
                                of my gilded name 
will circle around to protect me. 
                                                 And you'll be there, 
Unclear how my cousin has come to master hunger 
in wild birds. They call him, or he them 
by a quick whistle against his open palm 
or the rattle of worms and corn the songbird 
hears inside the plastic case. Often 
they spy him deep among his orchids and stare 
at him one eye at a time. However spare 
their frames, he catches their presence, then 
looks up to verify his favorite mockingbird 
or the loggerhead shrike, or both. He makes me 
sit quiet and still and tosses a worm to see 
which one will feed in midair and which, unafraid, 
A girl yawns like a cat beside the fountain,
an old Popes muscle in the gouts and spatter,
love-muscle in the plashing and the glitter.
Girl and fountain do not love each other.
Both are beautiful and both are vain.
She loves the water for her reflection.
A black cat stretches indolent in the sun
that gloves it lithely as if in silver
against the scarred volutes of travertine
on an old church. The young priest at the corner
stands in a quandary in his soutane,
caught in the glowing throat of afternoon,
clasped to her breast by Rome the giant mother
as is the pleb near the Gemonian Stair,
at his feet lute-shaped seeds of the sail pine,
beads of sweat like jewels in his black hair,
and the young man dressed in a wedding gown
and track shoes who, past flowering oleander,

unsteadily waltzes a mannequin,
busty and nude, down a runway of beer
while his friends shout O carità Romana!
Each private soul, carried to full and over-
full, falls at last to its disintegration
beyond the rolled edge of a starry crown
Each day drier, 
sandpaper skin 
pebbles my shoulders. 
Warty tags pop out. 
The high desert's 
adapting me, 
molding the squat, 
flattened shape 
and blunt snout 
of a short-horned lizard, 
one of a dozen species 
found in North and Central 
America. 
Spikes will grow 
along my spine—
yellow, reddish-brown. 
I look forward 
to the crown of horns 
sprouting on my head, 
poking through gray hair. 
Ants will be my staple. 
I've tried one, 
snapping it up, 
swallowing it whole. 
For balance, I'll chomp 
the occasional grasshopper, 
beetle or spider. 
Earth tones of my thorny 
hide will camouflage me 
from those who crave lizard—
hawks, roadrunners, snakes, 
dogs, wolves, coyotes, 
other lizards. 
Blue streetlight on the snow-limned trees like butaned rocksalt, 
on the post office & bar, on the red brick buildings 
with plywood lidded over their windows, 
                                                             & lightless houses with letters nailed 
to their doors
the doors like bulletin boards, making demands of the missing 
but the flesh that is kin to light & grass & wing 
is nowhere on the smalltown street. 
Third poorest county in the U.S., by last measure, by best guess, 
but it could be anywhere, it could be a hundred towns in the Midwest 
with two places open, & neither a grocery store, 
where old trucks sit in driveways, heavy enough to bookend 
the Book of the Dead, Midwest edition. 
And luck's rare as a three-legged cat, 
like the one that Higgs bosons its way each evening 
                                                                            through the deer-picked garden 
next door, little shadow, little hopalong shadow, 
if I didn't have bad luck I'd have no luck at all. 
Foxrare like gold dust, 
scarce as you, Old Ghost, 
as sunshine after sundown, the golden capillaries of a wounded body 
we never see, an aortic elsewhere, but one that passes through us
like rain through the earth, through the ribs of the dead, 
                                                                                this unseen body, 
body of muons & neutrinos, Old Ghost, someday 
the wounds will put our doubts to rest. 
And someday the rooms will be prepared, Lord 
the numbers have already been made for us, or so it's written 
on our Social Security cardsbut there are other numbers too, 
                                                                                          created just for us, 
arrest & case numbers, horsepower & BAC, pink slip & toe tag. 
Hard living, Lord, hard living, 
as close to the bone as far from grace, 
                                                         if & when we can find it. 
Till then it's mobile meth labs in the back of pickup trucks, 
or 2 liter Mountain Dew bottles for the chef who prefers to shake n bake. 
Till then it's old boors & cornmash, & an evening made for six strings, & a hollow heart, 
blues come scrub me, come leave me shining 
like prairie grasses. 
How surgical the appetites 
           that have cleared the deer 
to its skeleton I saw lying 
           in a ring of abandoned 
miner's cabins: hawks 
           and crows and wild dogs coming 
to pick bones clean 
           among the remnants, 
planks of roof and ellipses of iris 
           where once a garden stood. 
The bones laid out like a piece of lace 
           spread on a table. How carefully 
the work was done: the shape 
           of the deer intact, as if the object 
was to make the animal 
           apparent as possible. Anyone 
could have seen it, the form 
           from which the rest of the deer 
was mere corruption. The point 
           is always to get back 
to this: the fine nub skull, chinks of spine 
           unlocking perfectly 
from each other. Any other work 
           hatchetry, hunger beside it: myself 
wincing at the thin 
           pin bones of the fish 
snapping in their silky oils. 
           I wanted only to tear 
one sense of use 
           out of another. I have seen 
so many deer: dozens, 
           hundreds, but none 
more vividly than this one. 
           The hollow hairs 
of its gray-brown muzzle, scraps 
           of velvet twisting from the antlers
I've filled in the miner's wife, 
           her husband, children. Down 
to where the garden 
           could be found, its irises 
in flames of white and purple 
           someone planted, digging 
into the cooling ground 
           so each spring 
After the Hurricane
After the hurricane walks a silence, deranged, white as the white helmets 
of government surveyors looking into roofless 
shacks, accessing stunned fowls, noting inquiries 
into the logic of feathers, reversed, like gullies still retching; they scribble facts 
about fallen cedars, spread out like dead generals on leaf 
medallions; they draw tables to show the shore 
has rearranged its idea of beauty for the resort 
villas, miraculously not rattled by the hurricane's— 
call it Cyclops—passage through the lives 
of children and pigs, the one eye that unhooked 
banjos from the hills, smashed them in Rio Valley; 
they record how it howled off to that dark parish 
St. Thomas, stomping drunk with wire lashes and cramps, 
paralyzing electric poles and coconut trees, 
dishing discord among neighbours, exposed, 
standing among their flattened, scattered lives for the first time. 
It passed through Aunt May's head, upsetting 
the furniture, left her chattering something, 
a cross between a fowl and a child; they can't say 
how it tore down her senses, no words, packing 
their instruments, flies returning to genuflect 
at their knees, on Aunt May's face, gone soft; 
no words, except: Don't fret, driving off, 
as if they had left better promises to come. 
 
Moved by the Beauty of Trees
The beauty of the trees stills her; 
she is stillness staring at the leaves, 
still and green and keeping up the sky; 
their beauty stills her and she is quiet 
in her stare, her eyes' long lashes curve 
and keep, her little mouth opens 
and keeps still with its quiet for the beauty 
of the trees, their leaves, the sky 
and its blue quiet, very still and quiet;
her looking eyes wide, deep, silent 
The boy at my poetry reading wants to start a reliquary. 
He might be twelve, his belly billowed around him like a safety 
net for his body, and a head of curly hair the shocked color 
of saffron. His shoulders have the blockish weight 
of a kitchen cupboard but his voice is a child's, 
girlish and mannered. His name is River. 
He tells me the bolt he found along the bank of a river 
will be the first official piece of his reliquary. 
Meaningful objects are hard to come by, he says with a child's 
comic gravity, but I've got this bolt. Lifesaver- 
shaped erasers line the bookstore's front counter beside paperweights 
of Paris. In the Q&A his cheeks prickle with a rich, pink color 
each time he asks a question: What's your favorite color? 
and Do you believe in numerology? "River!" 
his mother exclaims when he asks my deepest fear, but he waits 
for my answer. I want to ask how he knows what a reliquary 
is. I want to know what the bolt looks like, if it's right now safe 
in his pocket and if the sign it held warned CHILDREN 
CROSSING or WIND GUSTS. A child's 
deepest fear is not of danger but of loss, though of loss that doesn't color 
what comes after. Absence without aftermath. He's so intent on saving 
what surrounds him that who he'll be without it must seem to him 
as abstract as old agea minor evil that the simplest of reliquaries 
could overcome. I want to hold the bolt's small, solid weight 
in my hand, hold its useless intention, but people are waiting 
to buy my book and tell me how when they were children 
they also lost their mothers, as if inside reliquaries 
we keep grief and not the rose-scented, colorless 
bones of saints. As if grief could carry us like rocks across a river, 
embedded in sediment so we might safely 
walk on water. But grief is the water: I have saved 
messages from answering machines and a nearly weightless 
piece of cork, several Post-It notes, and a petal from a river 
of curbside cherry blossoms that my father scooped like a child 
and let fly in front of my mother. Moth-colored, 
powerless petal. And thenisn't a book a reliquary? 
To all appearances they are having dinner, 
the two women sitting halfway back 
along the left wall of the Caffe Grazie. 
They've come from the Met museum where 
they wandered side by side, as they used to years ago, 
talking diagonals, frontal planes, brushwork. 
A sudden downpour has driven them here. 
Now they are face-to-face. They raise their glasses, 
laugh nervously, clink, sip, dip bread in olive oil, 
focus on the menu, talk lobster and coriander reduction, 
the earthiness of cauliflower custard. Light 
from votive candles wavers over them. 
The past is not mentioned. It has been declared 
off limits. It is not clear by which one, 
but it sits between them, a black hole, its 
gravitational field waiting to suck them in. 
But it won't. They are here "getting on with their lives," 
"without the baggage of the past," without amends, 
talking salade composé, talking pumpkin polenta, talking 
potato gnocchi. Rain blinds the Caffe's street front window, 
like tears behind contact lenses. These two are not 
having dinner. They are reaching their arms 
out across the unbridgeable abyss, 
dancing from foot to foot on its rim, crying 
"Mamma! Mamma!" 
"My daughter! My daughter!" 
talking granité aux fraises, talking espresso. 
Dmitry Itskov, 32, has a colossal dream: an early start 
             for his own 
             mechanical face. 
He's one of the men with brains, wondering How 
To evade 
             the death of meat, he thinks
By 2045 we'll have "substance-
             independent minds," then 
             no need for biology at all... 
 
At 25, he started to have the symptoms of a midlife crisis: 
the musical instruments unlearned, the books unread 
The more he contemplated the world, the more broken it seemed 
"What we're doing here does not look like the behavior of grown-ups, 
             killing the planet and killing ourselves." 
Decoupling the mind from the needy human body 
             could pave the way for a more sublime human spirit 
             It could allow paralyzed people to communicate, 
             or control a robotic arm or a wheelchair 
             It could allow you to start your car if you think, 
             "Start my car" 
Within a century, we'll frequent "body service shops," 
             choose our bodies from a catalogue, then 
             transfer our consciousness 
             to one better suited for life on Mars 
"From the very beginning," he said, "we realized Dmitry 
             was not an ordinary person." 
             He leads a life that could best be described as monastic 
             No meat, fish, coffee, alcohol, or cold water 
             Meat gives him an energy he's "not comfortable with." 
 
What is the brain? What is consciousness? 
It contains plenty of terrifying, brink-of-extinction plot twists. 
It's somewhere between a cellphone call and teleportation. 
It's speaking with his voice in real time. 
Get right up close to Dmitry Itskov and sniff all you like 
He has the kind of generically handsome face and perfect smile 
             that seem computer generated, 
             complete with all the particulars of consciousness and personality 
Yes, we have seen this movie and yes, it always leads to robots 
             enslaving humanity 
Orthodox Priest 
Black cassock hiding his feet, 
      he drifted onto the terrace 
of this hillside café with its view 
of the Laconian bay full of sunset, 
and took me from politics at our table 
to dim orthodox churches 
and chapels of the last two weeks, 
      to ikons and frescoes, 
those wide eyes of saints and scribes 
that resurrected my altar-boy moments 
of flickering candles, holy oil, incense, 
      and echoing quiet. 
Our talk tacked like sails on the bay 
as I watched him alone at the railing, 
gold crucifix at his chest, long gray beard, 
      kamilavka crowning his head. 
Far below were red-tile roofs, shadows, 
      the snares of everyday passion. 
Turning from the rail, he passed our table 
      and looked down on me 
from those ikons, frescoes, and vaults
reminders of sheer silence, thin places, 
caves, hermits, and monasteries 
      high in the mountains. 
Table talk returned to my ears. Cats 
      at my feet meowed for a handout. 
Our talk was politics again 
until loud voices and laughter had me turn 
to a table where the priest 
      now sat with the owner and his friends. 
Leaning back in his chair, legs crossed, 
fine Italian shoes exposed, 
      he was smoking a cigarette, 
arguing politics, and drinking ouzo, 
      just like me. 
 
Power Outage 
The room goes dark. 
Candles become the evening news, 
three wavering tongues 
From the lookout point 
of sleep's edge 
the years spread back 
with all the pinprick fires and dark clutches 
of an old, uneasy settlement. 
The thoughts watch themselves 
the way one falcon acts silent sentinel 
to another across the blue whisper 
of desolate distances.

How It Ends 
Progress
They say that for years Belfast was backwards 
and it's great now to see some progress. 
So I guess we can look forward to taking boxes 
from the earth. I guess that ambulances 
will leave the dying back amidst the rubble 
to be explosively healed. Given time, 
one hundred thousand particles of glass 
will create impossible patterns in the air 
before coalescing into the clarity 
of a window. Through which, a reassembled head 
will look out and admire the shy young man 
taking his bomb from the building and driving home. 
 
Among the Barley 
We met at the tail of a check-out queue 
and when she turned her head she spread 
like blood through snowflakes, all melt and fire, 
as my ripe tomatoes tumbled to the floor. 
And when she bared her chamomile thighs, 
her red-toed sunblaze, my body became 
barley fields on fire. My frazzled ears roared. 
My oId house flared to fizz-burned bananas, 
red meat frizzle-zings, the attic razed to hell, 
and I knelt at the doorway singing High Hosannas. 
                                   
After she'd cut her doorkey and laid out 
blueprints of her kitchen cupboards' insides 
I felt deep-bosomed, big-bellied and wide 
as a turnip field, days before harvest. 
I bought walking boots and walked through river-
wound groves. I bought allegories of birth 
and death, framed them, and drilled them to 
her wall. And how they fell. When she entered 
a room eyes swivelled and bulged for her, 
red crab-apples craving for the earth. 
                                   
For you, I wanted to leaf and take root. 
So I stood firm and pulled my lips full gape, 
wanting to mouth apples. Uaugghh. I uaugghhed 
nothing until it hurt. And then I surrendered.
Orchards of apples began to appear
pear-shaped, plum-coloured, pineapple-dappled. 
My eyes turned seed, my veins fructosed 
and my mouth bloomed stem-twigs for sound 
and wounded fruit for sense, gulping forth 
a juiced-up speech, or merely talking apples. 
                                   
I slap a second lick of banana dream gloss 
on the back room's walls while you measure 
the cove for hanging your unframed mirror. 
Soon we'll discuss our diaries, looking for 
windows when we can next DIY together. 
The forecast is for spells of lower pressure. 
I finger-slick sweat from your pent shoulders 
as the sun leaks onto the living room floor 
to trickle down thighs and thrawn limbs
barley sheaves waiting for the thresher. 
                                   
We walk a line that curves from day 
to day, often squiggly, higgledy-piggledy 
as if etch-a-sketched by a sugar-rushed 
two-year-old, so that I find myself 
rushing through a maze of malls, esplanades, 
restaurants, barley fields, beds, lakeside 
pathways, garden patios with sundials
meeting points that blend and deepen 
and brighten and bloom the way a room 
looks bigger when you've been in it for a while. 
                                   
When they choose to take material form they will resemble 
Dragonflies, not machines. Their wings will shimmer. 
Like the chorus of Greek drama they will speak 
As many, but in the first-person singular. 
Their colors in the sky will canopy the surface of the earth. 
In varying unison and diapason they will dance the forgotten. 
Their judgment in its pure accuracy will resemble grace and in 
Their circuits the one form of action will be understanding. 
I would drive the pre-dawn dark to stake 
my spot to fish for dinner, to numb my hands in the ice 
bucket, to pluck, from the neat stack, a herring, 
to fit the skullcap and pierce the eye with a toothpick, 
the body double-hooked, my fingertips glimmering 
with the scales of the dead while the line whined free 
from the reel, and the bait arced out over the tidal current 
on a point in view of the town where I lived, 
where I had become a man 
                                                with no money, 
suddenly concerned only with money, for there were mouths 
and I had helped to make them
the eddy swirled, kept my line taut, my 
whole body taut while a man a few down the row 
laughed and, sitting back on his bucket, pulled in more fish 
than he could take. 
I hated the other men, hated the ones who caught nothing, 
who crossed lines or hooked gulls, who plucked even birds from the sky 
and slowly drew them in while they struggled, even, 
finally, in the hands of the man who only wanted them free. 
I climbed the breakwater and fished and spoke to no one. 
I baited my line and thought of a woman 
who would carry my body over the threshold 
of our small white house simply with her eyes 
because I had brought something home, 
for her, for us, our boys at my side 
while one fish was divided and indeed did feed many
(now to sift the facts for truth): 
I reeked of the sea and had nothing to show for it. 
My father came down not killed 
from among others, killers or killed, 
for whom he'd worn a uniform, 
and he lived a long afterward, 
a steady man on the flattest of plains. 
I called after him many times, surprised 
when I heard the catch in my own voice. 
He didn't know how to find the solace 
of listening to someone else speak of 
what he'd seen and survived. 
He himself closed his own 
mouth against his own words. 
In the wrong sequence, his spirit, 
then his mind, and last his body 
crossed over that infamous, peat-inky, 
metaphorical water that has no far shore. 
I think he was carried like a leaf 
in currents so gentle that a duckling, 
had it been alive, could have braved them, 
but too strong for a leaf. And saturated 
I am evolving at the same rate as my spirit animal, but my spirit animal 
      keeps growing land legs. 
My spirit animal is the viscous age, the one that follows the digital. 
He is the far planet that has no bottom. 
He is the era and the future. 
He is the scholar of me and the genius of my life. 
He is the cradle when I fail. 
Every other animal is his enemy. 
Every other spirit is his thief.
It started at 6 years oldLeslie Baldwin 
with her wind-blue eyes, kissing me on the bus, 
some instantaneous undoing 
in the chestlight rushing out of me 
as she held her binder up to block the driver's view, 
as I ran around trying to catch my breath, 
feeling the clouds rising 
as I was unsealed from my bones 
a moment, and it all skipped out of time 
for the first time then. 
                                 Soon, I'd never see 
her again among dry oak leaves and palms, 
a mist through my teens and crazy twenties. 
What I thought was something 
failing beneath the ribs was nothing 
more than the cartilage of desire pulled predictably 
out of place. I was one more kid hard-wired 
with longing, with some intermittent voltage 
through to middle age when everything packed 
about my bones began to push the pump overtime, 
building up the walls, leaving the gizmo less room 
to function, which started to short 
the efficient exchange of air and full pulmonary 
reciprocation. I never had a chance.

Overnight snow in the east. Already a thaw 
By morning, and the blown grey smoke 
Of dissipating cloud-cover, natural law 
Unveiling itself, made infinite by the shriek 
Of a seagull, a few rooftops, the steeples 
Of two churches. Slowly the sun 
Irradiates, warms. But where are all the people? 
Why has the city shrunk to a point? I run 
To overtake the moment, without ever moving 
From the window-seat, or breaking out 
In any kind of sweat, lest the will take over. 
Listen, sit, be grateful for a day 
When nothing happens. Time, pure light 
And silence, the world looking the other way.

Out at the Mall

her new petit ami

I thought I'd caught

the unseduceable 
But the joke's on him!  
I know how that hair

once she's through 
Ever seen stubble

Riposte to Ode

I don't know anything about flowers though

the large coffee table book's 
unwieldy, chalky, 
gorgeous Edo prints: 
cats gnawing cherry blossoms; 
red banners trailing 
the confettied streets; 
snow lining bark like shadows. 
Only time for one, 
and I would promise 
not to turn ahead. But just 
as you were closing 
Hiroshige shut, 
you would cheat. A rakish grin. 
Tomorrow night's will 
We broke things. Glasses, a lead crystal vase, 
the ceramic chicken painted à la portuguaise. 
It was the longest, hardest winter in a decade. 
Snow against the windows, sealing us inside. 
I liked that part of it, sitting by the fire with a book 
until the lines began to blur and smear to black, 
like black behind a dream you know you'll wake from. 
I liked waking there alone, the chair a solid frame

before we crossed ourselves, tossed our de-thorned roses 
in the mud and drove west on 80, 
the hand-painted invitation hammered into the exit ramp 
barely catching our eye in the glow of the high beams, 
arrows winding us past the padlocked gates at the entrance 
for Land of Make Believe Park up the side 
of the mountain to a frosty clearing at the top 
where we crowded around each scope 
for a peek at the ring nebula in Lyra, the wobbly moons of Jupiter—
Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, 
what Sister Phyllis in 7th-grade science had drilled into us 
as the Galilean satellites, 
then a close-up of the lunar seas—Mare Nectaris, Mare Nubium, 
a crater near the northern pole miles wide, 
locked in perpetual pitch-black shadow, an ancient place, 
our guide pointed out, 
where souls were said to migrate, what early astronomers 
believed to be a bottomless pit, now found to be 
The habitants of Lesser Ransom, long acquainted with
evil, looked up from their preparations for the difficult
winter. The elder explained, The Prince of Darkness comes
riding his chariot. Of course, the experimental balloonist
heard precious little over the roaring fire that kept him
aloft in the heavens. Instead, he observed the villagers
kneeling as one in prayer. Perhaps he thought that they
praised almighty God for the miracle of manned flight.
All around them were strewn their antique implements:
their reapers, their knives for slaughterand on the air,
a tang of guts, pigs insides suspended from iron hooks
that turned in the wind. The balloonist took off his cap
and waved to the villagers, who could make nothing of
the letters in gold on the side of his basket. They knew
simply that from the earth, this infernal thing had risen
and that to the earth, it must return via a burning door.
I can't force myself to believe in any old 
                                             almanac, that the best days for fishing 
            will come mid-March, that fog in January 
                                                                       brings a wet spring. 
Most of my knowledge gets turned, or upset. Even chickens 
                         aren't completely flightlessthey can make it 
                                       over a fence, into the low branches 
of trees. In China, a man built his own dialysis machine, kept 
                                                 himself alive for thirteen years.

At the Maeklong Railway Market in Thailand, tourists marvel

                                             at produce stalls set right on the tracks, 
whole shops removed as a train barges through. 
Like clockwork, the market reassembles. I always question 
              the most rigid convictions. I can't trust a person 
                                   who plays the lottery, believes in planning 
I'll be skipping Mass again this Easter 
in favor of sitting at the end of this dock 
watching dawn break into the mouth of the Rappahannock. 
If the breeze is blowing the way it is today, the boat bumper 
hung from that piling will still be swinging like a censer 
and the pampas grass at the foot of that pier 
will still be waving its palm-like leaves. 
It's not the Dominus Flevit Church where, 
on the Mount of Olives' western slope, 
Jesus is said to have paused and wept, 
and from the front pew of which, 
through the arched window behind its altar, 
one can see the Temple Mount, 
beneath which, others say, the Divine Presence rests. 
Because the people I love don't believe in heaven 
we take the train to Brighton. Atlantic Avenue, Pacific Street. The ocean 
is always the ocean, so we take the Q. Seventh Avenue, Prospect Park. 
It's hard to explain. The tide rises, and we drink all the beer we brought. 
Before the restaurants, before the boardwalk, crackheads slept in dunes 
and girls turned tricks, or so we hear from a guy we met. He grew up here 
and for a living now he installs in bars electric chandeliers. In these waves, 
when he was young, his sister drowned, and because she's gone 
he takes the Q to Brighton. Church Avenue, Beverly Road. We don't speak 
the language spoken. At a loss to say what we mean, we take the Q 
to get there. And because the sun dies in Brighton, we know the day 
can end, and because the sky can't help but darken, we go home again 
to Boerum Hill. Cortelyou Road, Avenue J. In these waves, one night, 
one summer, I kissed someone. We walked through sands and bottle glass 
so we could touch the ocean the way the water can't help but touch the land, 
and in the end we couldn't help but touch, so we took the Q, that year, 
to Brighton. I didn't believe in heaven. It's hard to explain. Take the train, 
touch the sea, walk the sand. Kings Highway, Sheepshead Bay. 
The night my grief passed through me 
most completely, 
I was making dinner. 
I had lit the grill and reached as ever 
to give a quick metallic scrub 
and then I realized 
you were ash. 
It was the day 
however many days 
after your death they'd said 
cremation would take place, 
which hadn't struck me 
until the puff 
of these ashes in their shining chamber 
flung at me the knowledge 
of your body gone, incinerated, no mistake, 
no hope
                 me a zero stuffed with breath. 
A swarm of tears, and cries like 
none that I had ever made 
hauled through me, hauled 
my 'soul' my presence 
of mind my poise my 
being-anyone-at-all 
into a place of menace, the place 
where losing you meant losing everything 
about the way I see, make sense. 
So I learned what the words mean 
in accounts we always blandly read 
of ululation, dull eviscerating words, wracked. 
My husband now my oldest man observed in awe 
and the way he knows me also changed. 
He was a cleat and I was the boat, roped but 
thrashing the rope
Last night we were free     the moon     you     me. 
Our lips of spiced cinnabar burned through the dark 
and in barefoot abandon we dove into the sea. 
You     an azurite combustion     me     the Rose of Tralee. 
We swam clear coastal waters with a great white shark. 
Last night we were free     the moon     you     me. 
An offshore breeze seduced us so innocently. 
We shed shift and shirt and ran to the seamark 
in barefoot abandon we dove into the sea 
and rose so breathless I would not foresee 
so fickle a kiss. Why leave me in the dark? 
Last night we were free     the moon     you     me 
for my heart and love were eternal you see. 
You singed my lips     burned your watermark 
when in barefoot abandon we dove into the sea. 
Then put the banjo back in its case. 
Close door against the city. 
Make a rural sound. Be my key. 
Close down the bar. Sing a round. 
Let the fiddler be stoned in the alley, 
the mandolinist pinball long hours. 
Learn over and over. Still the needle, 
return to the solo, parcel out headaches. 
Pay for the room, measure the silence, 
run the notes. Play poorly for family 
in your manner. Live far away. Drift. 
Love everybody. Sound best alone 
in a minor key. Play it right. Turn 
your head when you have forgotten 
Two of them, sixty feet high, with trunks as big around 
as fifty-gallon barrels, lean at a corner of the house, 
sprinkling their tiny green burr-like flowers 
over the deck and, during windy thundershowers, 
dropping their sprigs of leaves, delicate as ferns. 
Just weeks ago they hummed with thousands of bees, 
a sound like a huge refrigerator left in the sun. 
When they were young they had fierce black 
two-inch thorns, but they have since grown old 
along with us and have tired of defending themselves.
Just now a nuthatch flits back and forth to the feeder, 
hiding sunflower seeds in the bald, wrinkled bark, 
and somehow a clump of grass has taken root 
in a sap-damp crotch six feet above the ground. 
On this mixing bowl of purest silver, 
made for the house of Herakleides,

ankle-deep in that rippling water, forever.

Once a man sent me a valentine under the circumstance 
that he "found it on the floor & decided to send it," a circumstance
which required me to throw it away, just as I threw
a book at John once to make him love me. Circumstances
shift, and today John's small baby who is my small baby ate
a blueberry for the first time. Magic, under the circumstances.
It is time to vote for President again and I've watched a house
be torn down brick by brick the past three weeks. These circumstances
feel connected but the reason sits shiva on the tip of my tongue. Like
"as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he" & the circumstances
on an exit ramp in Newark, NJ which led a man to hold HELP
on a piece of cardboard. I didn't, given the car & the circumstance

She was saying, "One arrives to the horrid 
of the Balze ... corrosion provoked by atmospheric 
agents, steep and deep precipices ... the Balze 
terrible shelter for the desperation of 
so many suicides ... have engulfed ... " But 
there she was and there it was, falling away 
below the walls toward the defenseless sea, 
wasteland of sand and clay, crumbling even 
as we watched, she, a daydream of mine in profile 
facing off against my nightmares ...

"We go," she said, and walkedoh, she walked
ahead: "Teatro Romanotheaterthe curtain rolled up 
in low, thanks to a complex system of telescopes ... 
dressed in marble, where the choir found its place, 
therefore ... a double order of columns Corinthian, 
Carrera stone, brought to light in the years fifty by 
Professore Enrico Fiumi with opportune structural 
interventions, in an epoch in which it was thought 
that work therapy" (here she smirked) "might be 
effective remedy for psychic throngs ..." and 
she a dead ringer for that girl in Tallahassee 
forty years before, down to that rousing, erect 
posture and tiny wrinkles round her dry, ironic eyes ...

... sweeping her lovely hand: "From the top of the 
mighty blocks of tufa an unforgettable and unusual 
show can be admired, as the result of the yielding of 
the sandy, em, layers of the Pliocene. Above all at sunset 
the precipice engages unusual and suggestive colorations 
when the shadows of the brooms, found on the gray 
clays, gives the rosy blue off from the sky background. 
There, beyond the abyss, on the frontal cliff tops, Badia 
Camaldolese, assembled 1030 and surely abandoned 
by the monks in the last century for fear that the building 
will collapse" ... Nothing made her smile like Volterra's 
teetering on the edge of this geological catastrophe.

It reminds me of when my cousin and I 
pricked our index fingers with a sewing 
needle filched from my mother's work basket. 
She had come to visit, but would be leaving 
soon. The blood pact was her idea. Mine 
was that I would perform any act 
under the sun to demonstrate my love. 
This be the cup, brimming fathoms of nectar 
This, the well that flows from forever 
This be the saltcellar, trencher of tears, 
and also the teardrop, stone-wept from ocean 
This be the stone, lost among cairns, 
and there, another, hidden in middens 
This be the hull that casts off its seed
thus grows the reef, encrusted with life 
This, ancient vessel, anchored to reef, 
This be the ark where life resides
A reeling blank propped up against 
The stretched and livid backdrop of the sky, 
It rips, black and top-heavy, through the fenced 
And farmstead-mottled plain a path, 
This turbine two miles high 
Of empty energy 
And aftermath, 
Debris 
Sucked spinning through its hollow core 
And flung around a giant centrifuge, 
Uprooted trunks and branches, a barn door, 
A roof the spooling pressures force 
To orbit in a huge 
And planetary sweep, 
The odd doomed horse 
Or sheep. 
A planetary sweep. And so, 
Our planet rides the empty gale of space 
Around the solar system, which with slow 
Aeonian rotation runs 
The light years round, to chase 
The vast galactic storm 
Billions of suns 
Perform. 
And whirling at the galaxy's 
Crushed hub, they say, a vortex, a black hole 
Is hauling light in, stardust, the degrees 
Of Kelvin, spacetime and dark matter, 
Beyond the last control 
The laws of physics sought, 
To tear and shatter, 
And make nought. 
And so the world. And so the mind 
Coils in the gyre of its own consciousness, 
Touching on matter to drag up and wind 
Around itself (or wind around 
The infinite recess 
It keeps dissolving in 
And is not found). 
Here spin 
All those poems I wrote 
About living in the sky 
Were wrong. I live on a leaf 
Of a fern of frost growing 
Up your bedroom window 
In forty below. 
I live on a needle of a branch 
Of a cedar tree, hard-bitten, 
Striving in six directions, 
Rooted in rock, a cedar 
Tree made of other trees, 
Not cedar but fir, 
Lodgepole, and blue spruce, 
Arrogating like 
Bacteria the fan- 
Lip of a draw to draw 
Water as soon as it slips 
From the snowdrift's grip 
And flows downward from 
Branch to roota tree 
Running in reverse. 
Or I live on a thorn on a trellis
Trained, restrained, maybe 
Cut back, to hold up 
His reds always clamoredmortars bursting, a plane afire, 
a gunner's barrage, gladioli, gunshots, or Golgotha's 
blood rain. He made no distinctions. His roses were fists. 
His roses beat obdurate fists against the eye. The stunned 
eye faltered, unable to distinguish: lonelylovely, 
both flames, both red, both proof of wounding. With a heated 
poker, he seared winter into the grain of a table leaf. 
Lonely was a winter storm, lovely was the heated poker. 
With one hand cradled in the other, his left hand levered 
the right. The right hand ferried the poker, held the brush. 
The brush raised its slurry of reds, its cadmium pyres 
and zealot's blood. It stuttered against the canvas, plied 
its impasto of lonelyno lovelyand lay the pictures 
that swayed his wary heart: Go ahead, now. Go ahead. 
Go ahead. Watch closely: A wounded vet, Negro doughboy, 
coddles a hog-bristle brush dipped in leftover house paint, 
limns, in scalded red, a fox running beneath a pelt of sky.
Another dead man's 
heart swapped 
for another living 
scarab, sprung Athena-like 
from dung. 
Sun-roller, emerald 
rival hung alive 
on horse tack, dangled 
from ball gowns, thousands 
of luminous beetles 
mashed 
to find their chemical trigger 
matches our muscles 
during contraction, 
only cold light 
loses no heat. 
Beneath the sheets, 
a chest floods 
It was eight hundred miles from Xi'an to Beijing 
    but from the windows of the train we could see nothing, 
        the landscape (was it temples? was it mountains?) 
            absorbed by a blotter of thick brown smoke. 
We breathed through our surgical masks but the particles choked us; 
    even behind glass they prickled our eyes and noses. 
        Half-finished skyscrapers loomed from the smog like nightmarish fingers
             all the way to the capital, in groups of nine or ten. 
We saw no one. We wondered where had the men who built them gone, 
    and from where the people would come, to live in them, 
        and when they would come. We'd grown accustomed to the taste of smoke; 
            we'd watched it hovering over the face of the water, 
the dwindled tributaries of the Yellow River. 
    Deep in the Forest of Steles we'd tried to decipher the characters 
        incised in rivulets down the standing stones: 
            a man is like a wishbone; a king one deft stroke less than jade. 
Dammed water harbors its force, but this smoke is unstoppable 
    and gets everywhere: in the Hall of Dispelling Clouds we watched the cumulus
         done on stone unraveling in scrolls; the incense in narcotic clouds 
            rise to the gold face of Buddha, carved from a single miraculous 
piece of sandalwood and fifty feet high. There were dragons sinuous as smoke 
    on the Nine-Dragon Screen. We crowded shoulder to shoulder 
        to peer at his empty throne in the smoke-blackened chamber: 
            Pu Yi's, last of the Qing. No chair was ever so vacant as this. 
(And we are motes, we flow through the city like smoke 
    where once the swift footsteps of soft-shod retainers barely sounded.) 
        After the Dowager Empress Cixi died in her bed, the malevolent aged plotter, 
            it was as though he just stood up and wandered away, 
Just look: the egret's white 
Reflects so like a cloud 
Pursuing other clouds, 
Which blow just like the white 
Of wind-borne sand that winds 
As if it were the wave 
Atumble, breaking crest 
All fracture like those shells 
That fall from gulls whose beaks 
Resemble oyster knives, 
More dull than razor clams 
And drabber than the speck 
Of freighter farther out 
Than one might ever hope 
To swim, especially you 
Who sees through glass egress 
who comes to the winter-flowering shrub, 
grief in his empty pouches, who sups 
alone in the stilled garden this dusk: 
I would have missed him only I stopped 
mid-argument to watch the moonrise 
over the wet roofs of the suburb 
There is no consolation in the thought of God, 
he said, slamming another nail 
in another house another havoc had half-taken. 
Grace is not consciousness, nor is it beyond. 
To hell with remembrance, to hell with heaven, 
hammer is the prayer of the poor and the dying. 
And as wind in some lordless random comes to rest, 
and all the disquieted dust within, 
Among them are volumes utterly bereft 
of irony: a Lutheran hymnal, a collected 
Shakespeare dollhouse thin. Perhaps 
they were assembled for a child's room, 
doled out to daughters solitary, formal, 
or plucked at oncefleeting impulse 
from an antiquer's booth, the proprietor 
barely willing to let them go. 
However they congregated, they sit now 
forgotten, lost behind glass, protective 
You ask what glories we have access to, being 
"excluded from the beatific vision" as defined. 
Best is the firmamentbarred from heaven 
but not the heavens, which open for us 
like a colossal jewelry box. I wish I could 
show you the odd-pitched graduated ladders 
that lift us to great heights of star-gazery. 
Up and down we traverse, birdlike in big- 
sleeved scholar's gowns, tailored to trap 
breezes and bear us up (we can climb 
only half as far without them). To see 
our billowing citizenry hung high amid 
the heavens, some with telescopes, some with 
maps and charts, others with sets of paint, 
is to witness a form of rapture, one 
in which no body need be left behind. 
If not all astronomers, or amateurs at best, 
we're all admirers who take our profoundest 
pleasure in planets and comets, in moons 
and meteor showers, in galactic treasures so 
phenomenal I'm not permitted to describe them, 
except to say, they're far beyond what satellites 
To me, he still looks dead: Lazarus, fallen, 
limbs rigid like planks of broken balsa wood, 
resting cold, like a dead man, 
in the hold of another's arms, head bent back, 
as if unable to support itself, or maybe 
just dead, with Jesus still pointing, 
cautiously, as if to say, Okay guys: let's try this again, 
the dark edges collapsing around the crowd 
as if neither the power of Christ nor the power 
of Caravaggio could change this moment. 
In fact, if Caravaggio hadn't titled this The Raising 
of Lazarus, I'd have no reason to think I was witness 
to the impossible. Yet here I am, like those painted 
into the crowd, watching the body for a flicker of life. 
The flare of a lung. A tremble in the lips. 
Here's the power of saying something, of suggestion, 
where the suggestionin this case, the painting's title
makes the audience strain to see 
what they're supposed to see: resurrection. In this way, 
the title is an invocation of sorts, though my mother
used to say, Saying something doesn't make it true. 
I have said all kinds of things that were never true. 
Though I wanted them to be true, longed 
for them to manifest, just as those 
in this corridor long for Lazarus to rise. 
Tell me: who hasn't been there among them 
who hasn't stood above a body: 
a friend or parent, a cousin or brother. A room 
with dead flowers and walls like the stone interior 
of an ancient tomb, and who hasn't bent above that body 
to plead: No, or Please come back, or You can't be dead.
So here's a board-and-batten house
a wall of planks with ragged ends 
behind the windows' splitting sills 
and here five siblings form a row 
straggling across the wooden porch. 
The boy frowns down and looks away, 
his sisters pose for me, the tallest 
raises her arm, juts her left hip, 
hooks her bare toes over the edge. 
Two first-grade girls, gap-toothed, grin wide, 
and one, her elbows high, leans right 
against the smallest child, hair chopped 
in crooked bangs, barefoot, sack dress. 
Say nine, twelve, six, six, and three? 
(It will be years before I frame 
family snapshots of my own.) 
Road dust rolls red as I size up 
more farms, more faded county seats 
with barbershops, small luncheonettes, 
thrift shops that sell used shoes, old clothes, 
worn pots and pans. I shoot them all 
as if I rode with Walker Evans 
in ninety-eight degrees. At night 
I wonder how what's saved was spared, 
what's razed was damned to disappear: 
who held the straightedge, drew the lines, 
called out neglect or preservation? 
Wythe County in JulyStare. 
Day after day. It is the way 
to educate your eye and more. 
Stare, pry, listen, eavesdrop. 
August, I turn back north toward home 
still steering down those rural roads, 
arriving at that weathered house. 
No one has heard of Walmart yet, 
though down in Rogers, Arkansas, 
Sam Walton's launched his Discount City. 
Scouting locations in his plane, 
he aims to move into Missouri, 
Sirens trespass through our bar window 
and a mess of red lights dance disco 
on our writing pads. 
We will not follow the dead 
or the dying, the child to be saved 
or born still, the old man whose engine 
has died mid-stroke, or the victim 
of multiple gunshots. We will not 
follow those dying from just living. 
The ambulance passes by and we 
remain snouts dipped in a river's 
rush only lifting up our heads 
to let the roar pass. Neither 
predator nor prey, and at times one 
or the other, we are poets in a safe 
They stitched their lives into my days, 
Blue's Point fishermen, with a smoke 
stuck to their bottom lips, bodies bent 
forward, inspecting a haul-net's wing 
draped from a clothes line. Their hands 
darting through mesh, holding bone 
net needles, maybe a special half-needle 
carved from tortoise shell. Their fingers, 
browned by clusters of freckles 
and tobacco tar, slippery with speed
they wove everything they knew 
into the mesh, along with the love they had, 
or had lost, or maybe not needed. 
During my school holidays I watched them 
and came to love this craft 
of mending, in our backyard by the harbour, 
surrounded by copper tubs brimming 
with tanning soup brewed from 
bloodwood and wild-apple bark. 
These men could cut the heart clean 
from a fish with a swipe of a fillet knife 
and fill buckets with gut flecked 
with the iridescent backs of flies 
as it fermented into liquid fertiliser. 
I'd water my father's beds of vegetables, 
rows of silverbeet, a fence of butterbeans. 
In the last of the sun, I'd watch 
Lateral
In spite of a dolphin wearing through, every two hours, his outer layer 
of conveyor-belt polymer, in spite of the spill of venom 
by which his affiliates used to lure 
mullet into their nets having taken its course 
through his veins, he simply won't hear of how his affiliates outsource 
their dirty work to another ring of the plenum. 
Even the blue heron may backpedal 
as he pins a medal 
to his uniformed chest while vaunting cutoff denims, 
yet a dolphin won't rethink his having left it to men 
to send mixed signals to the mullahs they processed in some holding pen.

Now rain rattled 
the roof of my car 
like holy water 
on a coffin lid, 
holy water and mud 
landing with a thud 
though as I listened 
the uproar 
faded to the stoniest 
of silences ... They piled 
it on all day 
till I gave way 
Why did I come tonight? 
Too late: I've handed my keys 
to some boy valet, polite 
to the point of insolence. 
He's so young, I'm so old
really, why take offense 
or even take the time, 
the precious time, to reflect 
that I was once like him, 
appalled at the parade 
of the hair-sprayed and the bald? 
I tip him, scan the crowd, 
and advance toward the cliques 
of nerds, cheerleaders, potheads, 
jocks, and Jesus freaks 
I'd felt awkward with, and forty 
years on, at last are peers: 
yes, this is my party. 
It's mid-June, and bright tents 
are erected to shield our kind 
against the elements, 
which hardly could be milder. 
A faint breeze stirs the scents 
of sunscreen, crab cakes, beer, 
cut grass, and gasoline. 
I think I'll get a drink. 
I begin to cross the lawn 
(ducking that guy I dated 
once or twice, and did he 
see me? Do I seem ... dated?) 
and spot, beside the wine bar, 
a whiteboard with Today's 
Specials in black marker. 
Why do I trust my eyes? 
I can't read at this distance. 
I'm nearer nowand surprise, 
here's what it really says: 
In Memoriam. What 
genius arranged for this? 
How thoughtful and horrible. 
Different hands have come 
as they once did at school 
to diagram the sentence 
of those who left us first. 
More like taking attendance: 
names, dates, an excuse 
for absence when it's known
cancer, accident. Who's 
that, Bob Rogers? Bob. 
My funny, uncle-faced pal, 
pride of the Drama Club, 
who tended to land the role 
of banker or judge because 
he had a middle-aged middle? 
Dead at thirty-seven. 
He probably looked the same 
as he had at seventeen, 
while most of us lived to stare 
for decades at the stage 
makeup in the mirror 
that gave back our true age. 
Bob Rogers. I played your kid. 
Our names met on a page 
in playbills kept awhile, 
tossed awayjust as I turn 
now from the other special 
Noon, but dark. 
                          Through the window, a long-
            toothed rain.

            I can't answer. 
On the news, refugees 
                          swim for their lives. 
            I remind myself 
that they're real. 
                          What I don't know 
            pours through 
every channel and 
                          makes its way 
            to another mouth. 
I watch the weather, 
                          practice being present 
            to elsewhere. 
Someone has decided 
                          what paradise is, 
            and for whom. Has mapped 
the coordinates, blessed 
                          the gated, powered the helios 
            fields luxuriating 
in their own fund 
                          of radiance. They're real 
            as well. Fields that recall 
Elysium, walls to admire 
                          from space, families swimming. 
            Interiors surface 
as architecture. 
                          I imagine the fields 
            upturning themselves 
to reveal a city 
                          made of fibrous lace 
            or lucid suspension cables: 
aerated design that gives 
                          structure but is somehow 
            gateless as sky. 
What power 
                          would constellate 
            our atoms 
in that alternate here? 
                          What skin 
            would encase us, 
and would we break 
                          everybody open 
            like we do now, 
as if to escape living 
                          inside the circuitry 
            of a blood system. 
These as-ifs 
                          we choose from.

Eight in the morning. 
The old woman down the hall 
is playing Fairouz. 
Gray rain stains these slanted roofs. 
Beirut smothers in sandstorms. 
The drunkard implores 
his neighbor's pretty daughter 
not to forget him 
in the grand old woman's song. 
Down the hall, she sings along. 
A hall of closed doors 
locked on possibilities, 
a hall of mirrors, 
each reflection is grotesque. 
Frontiers are rediscovered 
and fenced with barbed wire. 
My grandfather's language and 
the one I plug at 
shouted at each other, un-
comprehending. Mirrors, doors. 
The morning mirror 
is a window on the rain
early October 
like winter in this city. 
At the desk in pajamas, 
sorry for yourself, 
with dictionary open 
to hopeless desires, 
you write a word, close your eyes, 
hear footsteps diminishing. 
Diminishing light
still dark at six, six-thirty, 
beige gauze blinds down. 
The cafe has its lights on 
as it did five hours ago. 
Read for half an hour 
in bed, or grab a sweater, 
run a bath with foam, 
then coffee, newspapers where 
daily the darkness augments. 
My bald friend augments 
the ages of all women 
his age or older, 
writers, teachers, his colleagues. 
"She must be at least eighty." 
"No, she's sixty-eight 
if that makes any difference." 
"No, she's not sixty, 
she's fifty-four, like you are." 
(And his girlfriend's twenty-two.) 
Two surtitle screens, 
English and French. The actors 
act in Arabic: 
the sack of Ur; scribes, tablets, 
the scholar martyr who read 
and translated them. 
Rasha knows half the actors, 
slips back toward real life 
amidst gongs, lamentations, 
murdered words resurrected. 
Resurrected day
July's late afternoon walks 
to reconsider 
the unfinished, unstarted, 
all the way to the canal. 
Three more hours of light: 
you could start, you could finish ... 
That was then. Now dusk 
deepens before seven, and 
late afternoon becomes night. 
Bright fall afternoon 
to walk to the Mairie with 
a sack of towels, 
shirts, three backpacks, for the bin
collection for refugees. 
You wouldn't offer 
your friends two-year-old cashmeres. 
In cafés, they won't 
let you pick up the bill, and 
say "Next year in Damascus ... " 
At this time of year 
new classes take their form for 
teacher and student, 
proofs to read for Spring issues 
while mailing the just-printed Fall. 
I emigrated, 
mark the seasons without a 
work permit. So I'm 
a student again, translate 
three ways, begin forever. 
Whoever you were, 
I'll get used to your absence. 
Dinner companion 
of a decade and a half, 
her wit silenced at ninety; 
loves of my life who 
decided otherwise, now 
something else, or gone ... 
yesterday's brown eyes or green, 
yesterday's future now past.

Now, figs in salad, 
cut up, or figs in labne, 
green Italian figs, 
and blue-black Provençal figs 
from the three brothers' fruit-stand. 
Remember figuiers' 
branches overhanging stone 
walls, or the time we 
climbed a ladder to the roof 
and picked the late figs of Vence. 
Vence in September: 
on the terrace with Marie, 
we heard the ravine 
murmur its prelude and fugue 
to our reticent breakfasts
coffee, bread and jam. 
She was fifty-nine, and I 
was thirty-seven, 
that is, almost the same age 
as we turned to our day's work. 
A sonnet turns from 
affirmation to question, 
landscape to closeup, 
a routine doctor's visit 
from a chore to a verdict. 
The week-old child turns 
in her safe wooden cradle 
on a Kurdish rug 
The beat of oars, precise footprints neat as shadows over 
the surface of the void, moving together, race along the course 
with no room for the approximate, leaving a trail to follow 
the way letters began as the mark of cranes, messages in the blue, 
and where to go forward you look back at the irreversible, 
the consequence, chaining you to it, its tight whorls moving over 
the surface, so it's as if you stay and they move, telling a story 
in which you can't see where you're going until you've been there,

We seized the night and shook it till it broke, 
so time and bottles and most of our shoes 
spilled from its breakingand music gushed too: 
Paris and Nikos relentless till five. 
Blame them for this minefield of broken glass, 
our unreasonable outbursts of joy. 
Someone danced until his knees were bleeding. 
Someone said she had fractured her being. 
Then that night ended. Then sun, as before. 
Now the instruments unwind in their coffins, 
and we pace along the balcony and stare. 
The broken girl is asleep on last night's chair. 
It was a year of pirates in speedboats, 
anonymous bullies spreading privacies 
on the Internet, and the worst of them 
doing worse than that and wishing to be known 
for what they'd done, their perfidy 
an advertisement for a cause. 
Thus it was a bad year for historians, 
whose stories couldn't be correct 
for longer than a few days. More than ever 
the imperfections of memory 
would combine with the slipperiness 
of documentation to produce versions 
only people who need not be persuaded
could agree with. 
It was a war 
where the enemy sometimes was wearing 
the same clothes as its opponent, 
and both sides believed their cause 
was righteous, and years from now the victors, 
if we were unlucky, would tell it as it wasn't, 
In winter, by late afternoon, its almost dark
when you come home from the mine. I hear
the front gate creak and the metallic clink
of your pail before you round the corner
by the back steps where Ive been waiting.
In the sharp chill of the air, the mineral
undercurrent of damp earth and shale
comes with you. You turn down the collar
of your shirt and let water from the pump
pour down your face and nape, the skin above
your undershirt pale as the crescent moon visible
above the darker mass of the hills.
  
You drive for hours, heading nowhere; you walk
the streets at night and argue with the moon
something hidden and manic in you emerged,
almost unnoticed, until at last you huddled
homeless and bewildered under a pile
of coats in an alleyway no wider
than the mines you entered as a young man.
The rat scuttling in the garbage bin, the cat
stalking the rat, did they become your familiars?
And the passersby, who glanced at you and hurried
on their way, did they believe you were invisible?
Did the tag knotted to your toe say nameless?
Our grandson, aged two, 
announced that my wife, 
who is Mayor of our village, 
is "The Princess of War, 
The Queen of Nowhere." 
No one knows where he got it. 
His sister, six, 
professes ignorance. 
She swears she didn't put him up to it, 
and we believe her. 
Once he stormed into a room 
and declaimed, 
"I am Tragedy."
My wife and I 
are amused and mystified, 
but there's a darker side to this. 
As Mayor 
of a very small village, 
there is no way around 
a disturbing fact: 
She is 
The Princess of War,

Thunder woke us. 
Then we lay 
awake in darkness, 
listening to the rain. 
Neither spoke. 
Wind ticked 
freshened leaves 
against the screen. 
Our silence held 
no distance, but 
the distance
coming months 
would bring. 
Neither spoke. 
For absence, no solace 
but presence. 
Awake together 
in the darkness. 
A little longer in 
the same bed, 
the same weather.

Siri, show us a picture of an iamb.
& the pixels gathered on the phone screen,
Half-moon married to slash, scythe 
Beside spear-shaft. Crescent or chalice,
Then a wheat-stalk bending to autumn zephyrs.
& yes, the hearts-blood coursing:
Drumtap, birdcall, ringtone. Resplendent
Atavistic pictograph. Sympathetic magic,
Impious to demean it to concept, to symbol,
To sign. The tattooist took your phone,
Turned it & its pictures in his hand. Ponytail, 
Harley T-shirt, lots of bling. Shouldnt be too hard to do,
He said. & the instrument began its hum
& sable infusionyour right wrist,
The left clutching Kents calm hand.
Now youre showing it off to the six of us
Crowding the restaurant table, your hair nearly back 
From the latest chemo. Head half bent,
You pick at your salad. At your desk, 
You tell us, under the drafts of poems
You thumbtack to your wallpin them 
The way the rest of us would slap up Post-Its
You pause sometimes beneath the desk-lamp halo
& contemplate the fresh dark ink above
The indigo rivulet of vein.
You have three months. Later, the first-year
Med students in the MCV basement
Will pause to examine itabsolute rhythm,
Arranging their tools beneath the vapor- 
Light glare. Lancets poised, they ready themselves
To receive your gift, yet another 
Of your legacies. Dear friend, your faith
Lay always in unsealing, in the gnosis we carry,
Luminous & mortal within. But also outliving us,
Outliving us in word & act. Youd say this better 
& more plainly, in some anecdote
From one-stoplight Chatham, 
Seasoned with some lines from Dickinson, Welty,
Or Kitty Wells. Toward the end your poems 
Issued forth daily, fiercer & more knowing
Than any of us deserved. Absolute rhythm, 
Where sorrow is ecstatic. Grant us
The skill to learn their august cadences.
The waitress brings to-go bags. By stealth,
Youve picked up the tab again. The rain has 
Almost stopped & the parking lot shimmers in a pewter
Intractable light. Now the hugs & handshakes.
Turning, I glimpse the raven-black
I'm here to be cruel 
regretted the heaven official 
and I don't want you to spend 
your last few treating me 
like an interesting new 
So you will never find me
In this lifewith a sharp and invisible 
Fence, I encircle myself 
With honeysuckle, bind myself, 
With hoarfrost, cover myself. 
So you will never hear me 
At nightwith a crone's subtlety: 
With reticenceI fortify myself. 
With rustlings, bind myself, 
With silkiness, cover myself. 
So you neither flower nor mold in me 
Overmuchin my undergrowth: in my books 
I mislay, I bury you, alive: 
With fabrications, bind you, 
With any pretense, cover you. 
25 June 1922
Is it as I suspect not that rare for you to be 
wounded ravaged stripped of so much 
of what you wore with seeming pride 
your seething glittering oceans your forests 
nothing new for you meteors comets 
volcanoes extinctions the battering ice ages 
so perhaps we shouldn't psalm poor earth 
for truly we moan and despair for ourselves 
cast into that future we dread while the time 
in which we sorrowed you'll not have regretted 
because how can earth not have a past 
and how can earth even with a past so fouled 
Bring me your silent lake in the woods 
and your field of harvested grain 
with some rich man's horse pastured nearby, 
its eyes pearlescent, its tangled mane. 
Bring your late November rain, 
your hurricane plywood and muscle car 
the sounds of lovemaking under the bridge, 
your troublesome blurry stars.
Her hair's in your mouth, her breath 
a soft whistle, a baby bird 
here and then gone, the roses 
planted next to the porch 
slowly turning black in the dawn. 
Nothing tastes better than grits 
and eggs, eating French toast
and watching new snow 
dusting the crepe myrtle branches, 
frozen magnolia leaves clattering below.
It's a winter Sunday in the pine-tar South 
and the gray sky like distant satin
covers the roads and the smoky woods 
where mash whiskey cooks in a kettle 
and Lincoln's ghost squats in Oakwood Cemetery 
bent down, counting the Confederate dead. 
It's a scientific fact that it takes a year 
for the earth to go around the sun 
and I'm still a stranger in this world 
of the battle lost and the battle won 
though a pound of cotton weighs the same 
as a pound of tendon or bone 
and there might be a copperhead in the leaves 
outside the funeral home 
and sometimes the blues moans like a prayer 
and sometimes it spits out a curse 
The flute, the sackbut, the dulcimer 
in the rooms of the dying. The harp, 
the cornet, the psaltery. The look 
of the eyes' last seeing when the ears 
hear their final note or chord. The flats 
some know as sharps. A bee batting a screen. 
Thales of Crete appeased the wrath 
of Apollo with paeans to end a plague, 
and in all of Sparta's rooms, 
close with death, that conclusive music. 
But meadowlarks, too. Finches. Thrushes 
in the distant woods. Birds which are 
themselves flutes, sackbuts, dulcimers 
dressed in feathers. Up in Amherst 
Emily's last breath of the bobolink's 
virtuosic bubbling. A mother's cooing, 
half weeping, half exalted send-off 
heard beyond a locked door. Anywhere 
and often. In Pittsburgh the shrill whistle 
of the steel mill; how many have ridden 
that held note into infinity? In Treblinka 
the shrill whistling trains, the chuff, 
the cough, the high-note wail. 
On the Oregon Trail the pioneer's wheel. 
The ship's whistle for the immigrant 
whose filmed eyes never did see Ellis Island. 
The fading brain takes what it's offered. 
My mother's mother, no instrument 
but the clock ticking, the ice clinking 
its melt in a bedside tumbler. 
O, don't we each have our deaths set 
to music? Natural or manmade. The tabla, 
the tabor, the steam calliope. 
Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata" playing
tinny through headphones stuck 
in someone else's busy ears. C# minor. 
What do we hear there at the edge, 
the threshold, the dark verge, 
when sense, no more than a warm room, 
echoes emptily? How must the bedside 
cello sound, how the car horn, how 
the human voice hushing us at the last. 
Afterwards what's left out is what insists: 
a swath of tall leaning flowers on the way to somewhere else, 
a field lying fallow where the air quickens, 
                           where a curve arches more fully because of it 
and because tomorrow won't be here except as I fold the field as if it were paper 
to take with me, it won't be raining, it won't be tilting its light, 
it won't be full in the face. 
Time always matters, as the woman said, yesterday I am ... 
as if it were the present tense of a past time, the immaterial outside of the thing 
but the paper isn't what it was like, isn't even what itself was like 
before leaving. 
The attempt to separate my soul from yours 
is like wringing out a handkerchief 
wet from something spilled. 
I remember the burned-down house 
where a wreath still hung on the door, 
a wreath, stone-white to our surprise, 
useless, forlorn, like a life preserver 
nailed to the shore's churning rubble. 
You said the flames went off somewhere, 
strengthened, more vile than ever, 
perhaps seeking a child's crib. 
When speeding tires lofted street water 
onto your dress, I admired how you.... 
And afterward, I brushed your hair, 
as you lay dozing on the couch, 
your lower lip, a perfect, promising V. 
In towns that could be anywhere 
in America, you are exactly 
yourself, joined to a flawed body, 
sanded & smoothed, a shelf 
without varnish. When the last light 
shreds the sky, you'll lie awake 
alone or with someone, below stars, 
their indistinct edges. Believe in all of it, 
The cowled fisherman 
balances up to his waist 
at the center of the Waterworks lake. 
How bold was he, how tentative when 
he stepped from the shore 
and made the world his circle. Now he may cast 
extravagantly in every direction. 
They look too busy to retire. 
Or else some government has cut their pensions 
and they have no option but to remain industrious,
whatever it is that they do, exactly, 
at certain hours, when the tide has fallen. 
They scurry from hole to hole in great droves 
of rush hour traffic, each carrying his single claw, 
an outsized instrument of self-protection, 
though I prefer to think it really is a fiddle, 
and they are afraid of being late for rehearsal. 
Just to see them makes me feel alienated and idle, 
heading for my boat where I sit cleaning, or set sail alone
guilty, even deprived, pensioned off 
by a world that really doesn't need my assistance. 
So I tap them with my foot, just to be playful, 
but can't really hurt them. They suffer 
their brief setback in a stolid, manly way, 
always finding a little foxhole for refuge. 
They reassure me that way, a population 
that lives for work and not for war, 
disregarding my mock attacks from the air. 
Like the Dutch, a small, industrious nation, 
practical and modest, their domestic life 
orderly, even sacredor so I suppose, 
though no tiny Vermeers record it. 
I love the way they keep their private lives to themselves, 
menacing an intruder with their outsized claw, 
and accepting grieftheir hollow carapaces 
on the deck of my boat, all the meat eaten by gulls
without posting about it, or staging ceremonies. 
Though perhaps they are religious, and hurry to worship, 
believing the tide won't return to feed them its harvest 
unless they're on time for their twice daily services? 
The flowers die, the flowers come back to life. 
Through the rainbow blinds, I point towards my lost star. 
It's like I'm that sad usher waving her torch 
along the rows of the Astor Cinema to make sure 
the courting couples haven't gone too far. 
Crushed Coca-Cola cans, Monster Munch, 
Sam Spudz Thicker Crinkled Cheese 'n' Onion. The smell 
of popcorn and of piss from the men's room. 
I throw a ball into the dark, the ball comes back. 
I step once more into the backyard of it, light washing 
through the slats of the unkempt garden shed. 
Its rakes and hoes. Its charcoal and lawn seed. 
I sit out in a deck-chair, wait for whatever it is 
to take a form. I leave a trail of Skittles or M&Ms 
on the off chance it might follow me home— 
this creature who is me and not me I'll conceal 
behind the bedroom closet's louvered doors, 
his head nothing anyone would ever look for 
amidst the one-eyed teddy bears and GI Joes. 
The way his skin is stretched across his bones 
puts me in mind of some ageing relative 
whose veins begin to show through the translucence 
like the curves and discursions of a back road. 
Whin bushes and fuchsia, oak and ash, potholes. 
A strip of grass running down the middle 
like a Mo-Hick haircut as my aunt was wont to say 
of what must be Dolan's Lane or Dolan's Brae. 
I take the long way round again so as not to be seen 
in my Lord Anthony coat and my bell bottom jeans. 
His sacred heart, his telescopic limbs 
remind me I'm space cadet, I'm alien, 
a blow-in on my way home with messages. 
Soup meat wrapped in brown paper. In waxed paper, 
a sliced pan. A plastic bag of bones the dog 
will bury in the ground where later we'll bury him. 
I carry it all in the basket of my mother's Raleigh Shopper 
that I wish were a BMX, or a Chopper, 
a flame motif across the double crossbar 
on which my cousin, acting the goat, will split 
his scrotum right between the stones. To think 
of it is to cross your legs like that girl in the back row 
who fears things are about to go too far, 
her souped-up lover staring at the screen, 
where those two brothers sniff the warp and weft 
of their absent father's shirt for the scent 
of Sea Breeze or is it Old Spice, as his hand 
climbs the incline of her thigh. I lie down 
beside it again, go eye to eye with it. The spilled milk 
on the kitchen floor. The cold sweat on a can 
of Coors. I finger the dial of that transmitter and receiver 
conjured from a circular saw blade, a record player, 
the keyboard from a Speak 'n' Spell. I hold 
my ear up to the unlabelled baked bean tin of it 
and hope you'll pick up at the other end 
and talk to me along this piece of string. It's been too long, 
and what I want now more than anything 
The calf was tired from being born. 
Its mother had disappeared. 
Lying in the grass the bright brown 
body with its 
perfectly white face 
as if deflating 
thinned out of sight almost. 
It could stand no longer 
even with human help. 
I thought it 
lost. 
But just a little later, 
once the knowledgeable farmer 
who runs the place arrived, 
the mother was returned 
and the calf played 
skipping through the dimming light 
Oleg had white teeth, but Natalias were golden.
He taught navigation at the Frunze; she, physics 
at Public School 625. He said literature was a drug, 
and she came shouting, red-faced from the kitchen. 
Dima, twenty-two, drank vodka in the metro 
on the way to morning class. He mocked the KGB 
right there in the living room. I thought he would
cry when I gave him the carton of Marlboros.
Natalia began to look at me all the time, and Oleg 
looked at her looking at me. At the celebration 
of Womens Day, their friends, whose daughter was 
still too alive to mention, looked away from Natalia 
when she looked at me. They insisted I sit in the 
cushioned chair. Had they visited the U.S.? The men 
looked embarrassed, they looked like boys 
when they said they had seen San Diego 
through a periscope.
Slept on the train 
Slept in the car 
Woke at the border 
What is a border 
Slept again, woke again 
on that remembered street 
Unchanged or 
changed, hard to tell 
I didn't know who 
I was even, felt 
like a cipher, a corridor 
Things went by or 
through me, and was 
that what it was 
to be a me 
That none of it 
was mine I knew 
thought maybe to be 
was to be as another
Followed her through the city 
the makeshift memorials 
studding the streets 
She wanted me to see 
I wanted to see 
Not speaking the language 
it was all iconography 
image of the butcher pig 
image of the child 
cradling a candle flame 
against the backdrop of night 
It was one way of saying 
what it means to be in time 
what this time means 
or meant, to who or whom
But some things never change 
even in revolution, the shape 
of a hand at rest, holding 
what secret, the dream 
of the lover, tight spot 
in the small of the back 
which is to say the body 
limited or limitless 
in its pains, its pleasures 
Rainwater, snowmelt 
the river rising 
as the city is fled 
or occupied 
renovated or razed 
That bodies in motion 
stay in motion 
this was the principal 
lesson not of physics 
it came to seem to me 
but of history 
that pendulum 
that cannot stop 
or the unthinkable river 
that sweeps it all away 
past the border towns 
the razor wire 
of no man's land 
to the sea 
Locker-room truant in a locked stall 
                      Through study hall 
              Hiding, hand-stifling her cries, 
A girl wide-eyes the unimagined smear 
                      Of blood rusting 
              Her fingertips. Secret, quaint horror. 
Some betrayal of the flesh has left her 
                      Vulnerable, 
              Her blithe pellmell 
Redefining to this singularity. But no. 
                      She is smarter 
              Than her body. She will starve 
This woman out, she will run and outrun 
                      The turncoat moon. 
              She will firesale down 
To a shoestring inventory: item: 
                      Two eyes, indifferent 
              Blue; item: brain and brainstem; 
All afternoon, in slate grizzle, 
   beneath the yews, black shag 
      grove where others grazed, 
indifferent, some on hind legs, eating 
   like the Girl with No Hands 
      in an old tale, the doe strode, 
steamed, fell, rose again, 
   & by sundown still just those two, 
      milk-hoofed ghostly limbs 
of fawn hung out of her, slipping back, 
   emerging, again, out, in, 
      the ropey noose 
she leaned her elegant head 
   back to snap at, repeatedly, 
      amnion alien pulley. 
While I slept, she did not. 
   Next evening, the tawny hour, 
      herd conspicuously vanished, 
the space cuffed, muddy, thrashed, 
   so whiskery with light snow 
      I almost missed it, stepping 
among fecal pearls, stain faint 
   as girlhood on a thrown-out skirt. 
      She'd eaten it well, 
her own blood, placenta, basal plate, 
   but not this tissue frozen 
      to cellophane, weird, cellular, 
Another day of slant rain 
that comes in sheets and obliterates 
the landscape for minutes of time 
and yet there are spaces between 
through which one can almost see 
a body or two, tucked in, refusing day's 
advance, coiled under a comforter, 
like delayed half-rhymes 
in a love-duetsweet banter
before the dead reckoning, 
the friar delivering his liquor 
that yields the likeness of shrunk death 
for two-and-forty hours, from which 
like a sprung rhythm the youthful 
one will spring up again ... 
if only. The day is like a Guthrie 
production that wants to be high 
art but can't quite kick-start itself 
out of malaise, so it kicks around the manse, 
waiting for funding and the producer's say-so 
he thinks it'd play better as an off-Broadway 
show, risqué, that's just made its way 
uptown to where the lay crowd hangs 
out, and keeps its clothes onbut never mind. 
The rain's washed over the lake and hills and 
away it goes. The lake and hills remain. 
I'll need to send the lady away, buckle 
my buckle, and buckle down, refrain 
from playing with language and other 
things just for thrills, or frills, and 
grill myself or my environment 
with the sorts of questions 
Like a runaway artist, you used to flee 
your patients' modern anguish at home 
to stroll along the ochre squares of Rome, 
to sketch a yellow leaf, a tawny hound, 
to see unvarnished color with free eyes 
far from our jaundiced complaints, 
from having to be wiseas you've escaped 
from all of us now, your therapy room 
now a studiolo, with a gallery of work 
you'd never have hung before, 
for fear of disturbing "our work." 
And after your attendant 
guides you up the elevator that 
we, your patients, rode (almost over- 
weighting it with our emotions 
so some days it barely chugged 
to the tan walls of the 21st floor) 
you approach your door with 
yellow mimosa that you'll paint, after 
you unlock it, having learned 
to use keys again, holding 
both hands to twist the cylinder. 
When you lived as an artist on the lam 
for that month each year, you used 
the watercolor pencils in your hand 
not to note our dreams 
(and now, who cares?) 
but to draw the jonquil things you saw, 
and live the raw I am, as you do now, 
relearning how to show 
The fruits fall all December, 
flesh pulled soft across each skull, 
at dawn a feast for gingy-flies. 
I mistake each thud for horses 
out the window, where the sea grinds 
the air thick with my mother's cannabis, 
the pollen of her sweet cure-all, 
as she collects the fallen mangoes 
and chants my name at the battered sky: 
Montego Bay, Thermopylae. 
My finger a stiff bullet of karst limestone. 
My mother's song her only version of prayer. 
Little sister emerges from the wall to scrape 
me clean. Dust settles in the fringe of her lashes, 
but she does not complain. 
All winter I've been petrifying in this greenery, 
my body a fixed bolt; sheets of dermic ash, 
stirrups of bone, and one black tooth pulsing 
canines in my heart. Mother, your cannibal 
lives there. Where the first teething 
on rough cement left me dissolved 
inside of you, absorbing everything 
that made you acheyour clothes soaked 
with blood every night, your hair growing
thick in places you had never seen. 
Now this morning you have come to reclaim 
me, carrying my name in your throat; 
but I have purged myself empty 
in our seaside home, a sea fished barren 
by your father, his traps long salted dry, 
the sternum of my body now a relic 
in the sand, as grayscale claims this maw 
of pelvis, my womb the coiled rock of coral. 
Nothing will survive here. 
Ossa, Infanta. 
After a year of too much face time, 
I came where I could choose, instead of people, 
birds and their slant gaze, water, trees and clouds, 
the gossip and confidences of cat's-paw breezes 
across the face of a lagoon. 
I knew the place was the byproduct of money. 
I knew it was peace that the state had paid for 
though only a few who knew about it prospered. 
There was a bench in the sun that looked out over the shallows, 
near where a black phoebe fluttered and looped 
and a great egret slid one foot forward at a time in the thin water. 
And there was the heronry, a thicket of slim-branched eucalyptus, 
where the night herons in their black caps and sturdy patience, 
like security guards, roosted and slept. 
I put my eyes to binoculars, a pen on a notebook page. 
Students rode by, lugging surfboards out to the point. 
I heard all kinds of chatter, but always in a passing stream. 
Simply to watch as other creatures lived, 
stalked each other for sex, ate, 
or staked their territory with frantic displays 
or like cormorants dried their wings in the sun, 
simply to stand apart and be something else, 
the note-taking one, inconsequential, 
lent me a greater peace than prayer
to be no more than a stump or a rock, 
yet too untrustworthy to nest in or light upon ... 
I'm talking about a few minutes of stillness a day 
as birds did their work and, stiller than I, 
the golden bush and ice plant ingested the sunlight, 
the clouds, always moody, chose a single mood, 
the night herons studied their dreams, 
and a loneliness that I still believe was solitude 
dusted me with its pollen. 
The water twitched a little. 
I pretended I had it all to myself. 
I tried to observe behavior I could note in my book, 
though every time I thought I'd captured a stride or wing beat, 
it altered, or the hunter missed. 
And I hadn't come there for knowledge, anyway. 
I don't know why I came, to tell the truth, 
except to be alone, though I wasn't alone and don't think I wanted to be. 
Once the crack of a branch, falling under a bulky red tail hawk, 
sent a murder of crows, like a loud black rainbow, 
arcing across the lagoon. Every other bird scattered, 
except the night herons, who didn't stir a bit, 
hunched on single legs on single branches. 
Some people in the distance pointed. 
And I was glad to be there, looking where they looked. 
It is the tightness in the gut when the load 
is heavy enough to knock me over backward, 
turn me back on my heel until my ankle cracks 
and I holler out Jesus, this Jesus of Joe Gans 
setting up for the next punch while taking in 
one that just made his soul wobble, the grunt 
I make when the shift is young, my body 
a heavy meat on bones, conveyors not wired 
for compassion, trucks on deadlines, uncaring 
pressure of a nation waiting to be washed, made 
clean, me looking into the eye of something like 
death, and I look up, throwing fifty-pound boxes, 
Jesus now John Henry pounding visions of what 
work is, the wish for black life to crumble, snap 
under all it is given, these three souls of spirit, 
hands like hammers, a hammer like the word 
made holy, word echoing a scripture from inside 
the wise mind that knows men cannot be makers, 
We opened the door to the fairy house
& took our tea on matching pebble seats.
Somehow we got out of there alive
though something crystalline of us
remains in that dark, growing its facets.
We opened the door to the fairy house
at the oak's black ankle. You asked
What could happen? as you disappeared
somehow. We got out of there alive
the strange tea still warm in our bellies.
Inside, our hosts gave damn few answers.
Who built that door? Is this a fairy house?
They had no faces yet. We spoke
into their quince-bud ears. You wept.
Somehow we got out of there alive
Strange place I resist calling homesquat 
            on gray-painted brick foundations, 
                        only the top half of the siding 
in a fresh coat of pale yellow; 
            the rest, surrounding the tucked door 
                        to the right, flaking like mammoth dandruff. 
Four blistered black mailboxes, 
            all unnamed, the mossy gaps 
                        in the leaning rail, and above it, 
hanging off box nails: two fist-sized pots 
            hold faded geraniums
                        both plastic and weightless 
as they sway like spent debutantes. 
            They match the green porch carpet, 
                        its rents along the edges 
of the top step, and the kale-like curls 
            along the wall where it touches 
                        my new front door. 
I've been cleaning this place winter-long, 
            immersed in abrasion, in wiping 
                        foot-rails with damp terry cloths. 
Now each doorknob is polished
            brass, pewter and Bakelite. 
                        Each shade, globe and shield 
unscrewed from its fixture 
            and the paper-like moths rinsed out, 
                        ribbons of settled dust 
removed from the tops of doors. 
            Paint stains, large, looking like pigeon 
                        droppings, scraped off tiles, 
and the kitchen's grimy linoleum 
            now bleached into paleness. And, as I bend 
                        and rise, my hands as if in oblation, 
mimicking death and resurrection, 
            I trace dirt and clay settled in the grout, 
                        cobwebs that waver complicit in corners. 
Back and forth with the heel of my palm 
            I try to remove time from the worn carpet, 
                        restore something in this house 
perched over the two-lane road
            uneven, rough, like sore taste buds
                        where trucks continually pass 
and with them these camphor-white ceilings 
            and the single panes shudder. 
                        Only traffic romps in here. 
And across the street, children cry 
            above this noise, learn to know 
                        their voices. And as I quietly wash, 
all over again, each door in warm soap, 
            my hands wipe away the six hundred miles 
                        between us, remember the borrowed houses 
that hid us, hushed the billowing 
            inside them. I think of how right now 
                        someplace boats are leaving their docks, 
how easily they movelike the lifting 
            of eyelids, the sound of dawn, like breathing. 
                        And with my hand sunk 
I pray that words 
come like water 
in first runoff, 
ice turned free 
and sing-songed 
over moss and rock 
as drumlin changes 
from glacial footprint 
to shadow between 
neighbours. 
Pray that each letter 
as they shall follow 
finds those unmolested 
by sentiments left 
at the margins, snow 
piles left in a cold 
dark place beneath pines. 
He sighed each April upward, 
his steady, virescent journey one 
among the othersa modest rising, 
casually miraculous. Beneath the hand 
of the rain he leaned upon his axis, 
and often leaned so far as to kiss 
with tender floral primordia 
the funky, black, bug-shot loam. 
Though supple as he was he did not 
bruise nor break, no, not even 
in the wind, which came some days 
screaming down the mountain 
and took the limbs of muscled oaks 
and twisted them to splinters. It's true, 
it went mostly unnoticed, his work, 
which was to risesimple, green, and thin, 
and go one sunny day wildly blue 
to be loved, then, by moths and mason bees, 
to shake, finally, and scatter, to urge 
every sugar to the root, to feed the earth 
as it fed him. He knew this. He knew 
his creek bank. He was everything 
he loved. They gouged one day a road, 
and like the others he was unearthed, 
was left to rot along the verge. The wind 
lifted up the stench, carried it down the creek, 
up a river. The girl who breathed it 
frowned, breathed again, and years later 
became the boy's mother. She took him, 
as was her wont, to creeks and rivers, 
where he knew only that he should dig, 
work the creek mud with his bare toes
             I had heard the story before 
about the two prisoners, alone 
in the same cell, and one 
gives the other lessons in a language. 
Day after day, the pupil studies hard
what else does he have to do?and year 
after year they practice, 
waiting for the hour of release. 
They tackle the nouns, the cases, and genders, 
the rules for imperatives and conjugations, 
but near the end of his sentence, the teacher 
suddenly dies and only the pupil 
goes back through the gate and into the open 
world. He travels to the country of his new
language, fluent, and full of hope. 
Yet when he arrives he finds 
that the language he speaks is not 
the language that is spoken. He has learned 
a language one other person knewits inventor, 
his cell-mate and teacher. 
 
                     And then the other 
evening, I heard the story again. 
This time the teacher was Gombrowicz, the pupil 
was his wife. She had dreamed of learning 
Polish and, hour after hour, for years 
on end, Gombrowicz had been willing to teach 
her a Polish that does not and never 
did exist. 
                     The man who told 
the story would like to marry his girlfriend. 
They love to read in bed and between 
them speak three languages. 
They laughedat the wife, at Gombrowicz, it wasn't 
clear, and I wasn't sure that they 
themselves knew what was funny. 
I wondered why the man had told 
the story, and thought of the tricks 
enclosure can play. A nod, or silence, 
another nod, consentor not, as a cloud 
drifts beyond the scene and the two 
stand pointing in different directions 
at the very same empty sky. 
                     Even so, there was something 
else about the story, like teaching 
a stunt to an animala four-legged 
creature might prance on two legs 
or a two-legged creature might 
fall onto four. 
                     I remembered, 
then, the miscarriage, and before that 
the months of waiting: like baskets filled 
with bright shapes, the imagination 
run wild. And then what arrived: 
the event that was nothing, a mistaken idea, 
a scrap of charred cloth, the enormous 
present folding over the future, 
like a wave overtaking 
a grain of sand. 
                     There was a myth 
I once knew about twins who spoke 
a private language, though one 
spoke only the truth and the other 
only lies. 
                     The savior gets mixed 
up with the traitor, but the traitor 
stays as true to himself as a god. 
 
Pacing to and fro
Along the autumn shore
Among the wrack and reek
With your arms clasped behind your back
And sporting your grey frock-coat
Trimmed in black
And your black hat and your lean long-legged stride,
Up and down the strand perusing
The headlines of the tide:
Casualties and statistics, futures, stocks,
The thousand natural shocks,
You clear your throat
Inspecting the ink-black seaweed tossed among the rocks
Like obsolete typewriter ribbons, rusty widows weeds,
Scanning the flotsam for
Morsels cast up by the remorseless gossip of the seas
Éminence grise,
How elegant you are, everyone concedes,
Gentleman Crow,
With your gimlet gaze, your sardonic beak,
How omnivorous, how sleek.
You shrugged off the raiment of the living 
          and I knew I would forget you, 
                    the way all the dead are forgotten, 
          becoming an archipelago 
reconstructed in dream. 
And so it was your name in our mouths 
          became a prayer uttered 
                    in a strange tongue, a snake 
          swallowing its own tail, an island circled 
by a ship without port. 
This is the last barricade, firebreak, red line. 
Across it, 
We will no longer shake hands 
As friends, politicians, or drinking buddies. 
The final day, the last sentence, the last chance. 
At the border the word we will go up in flames. 
The word you won't make it through the fire. 
Only they will remain.
Tonight let's sit awhile on our suitcases filled with reason, 
Our backpacks bulging with feelings of honor, 
And count a lifetime's worth of pocket change 
For the road ahead, or back. 
The carabao arrived on our street bearing the world, 
pulling a wooden cart hill-high with watermelons. 
Its handler, a man the rich color of coffee, tugged 
at the driving line, a rope tied through the septum 
circumnavigating master and beast. Seated beside 
the man was his son, a mocha version of himself. 
As I was, paler than my mestizo father, who met 
the melon sellers with our neighbors, lured by cool 
promise of relief from the tropic's audacious heat. 
Outer gentleman, watermelon lover, my father 
scanned the stacked pyramid, held up a dull fruit, 
palmed the creamy, yellow underbelly, weighted it 
cupped in his all-knowing, all-punishing hands. 
Next, a gentle knock, like he'd do before entering 
their bedroom restless past midnight. His knuckles 
bounced off the bell-domed curve, he listened, eyes 
closed, and, as he is dead now, for years, he longed 
for that sonorous sound echoing inside the dense 
A coastline, a transitional place 
bears evidence of others dwelling: 
a house pit in the shape of a nest, 
another like a knife, a noose 
not lost not in time. Ours 
a useful relationship though not a tight one, 
for between us we knew there was something to lose. 
Fragrant in June heat & a field of confusion 
nothing like metaphor: moss campion, 
minute orchids, sweet 
The canal's middle swells with waiting 
for odd hours of night in the middle of the day. 
North appears everywhere, the now of the snow, 
warming ice counts itself away in different 
sun angles, like a block of frozen ink 
insisting on the line. The water knows 
the way down, to the Titanic and her two 
sisters. She rouges her silver likeness, 
buttons her gown herself, so high, so closed, 
her days malodorous from saturated skies. 
Do you think it reflects well on our city 
to ones who arrived only a week ago 
to go outdoors in pyjamas to the turgid 
bar district, the Gucci outlets in the city's 
revamped living room? To photograph 
a child on the King's Highway? 
Arrival city—where disaster zones have become
more theatrical, ambitious parks obsessed 
with self-esteem are honeycombed 
with missions and endeavours and offers 
of salvation as an incandescent life force. 
Gone is the edginess of the city, cleansed 
of conflict, argument, debate, protest, ructions 
and ribaldry, notwithstanding the spy cameras, 
the pop-up shops, the flash mobs of drink-
fuelled petrolheads, the new Purple Flag award. 
I still have to define my life through the false prism 
of Samson and Goliath, the ailing road perfuming 
the heavy curtains of Parliament. We still show 
our papers to reveal where we are going. 
The youngest won't fall asleep 
though he keeps resting his head on the table 
next to his empty plate. 
These are the jewels of his 
half-open eyes bewitched by the pale 
blossoming spines of the centerpiece flowers 
no one remembers the names of 
these are the sparks flying up 
from the fire and the night 
pressing in on the windows. 
Eight months on, grief burns itself out, 
leaves quiet, smearing ash. A face, 
a spit-damp rag. A blackened field 
in rain. My smile's willed 
and brief. All right then, I insist
a productive day. And schedule 
carefully: work, tea with a friend, 
a run. I will pretend 
a busy breathlessness, which is, 
I'm sure, its own reward. And do 
allheadlong, a little grim
but later at home 
recall only chatter as limp 
as boiled food. Its own reward? 
Well, the other option's sitting tight, 
trusting summer heat 
will coax some movement out of me, 
asleep, cold-blooded on a rock. 
Is grief's aftermath also grief 
a latter, deadened trough, 
a kind of char that's part of burning? 
If so, fire ephemeralsblooms 
that follow forest firesought 
to flare shortly. If not, 
Ghetto miraculous, 
     tipsy monastery, mysterious 
embroidery erupting rashly 
     in thatch beneath the dying ash, 
gnomic roofs of steep snows, 
     bee skeps on hollow stems, blown 
honeycombed tutulus 
     with whiff of kiosk, 
cloister, old world side-show 
     trousered intimacy, glass-blowers, 
or the throat swollen in filigree 
     by a swallowed key, or bee: 
I am the one
who took the photo,
the one
who on a frigid moonless night
was summoned, instructed
to rise from a warm bed,
Turn any corner in this village, 
the owner of the eccentric bookstore assured me, 
and you are likely to run into 
the history of Greek poetry, 
and sure enough there was a woman 
picking out lemons from a pile of lemons 
and a barber leaning in his doorway with folded arms. 
I even thought I saw Yannis Ritsos 
whispering something to George Seferis 
as they sat under a white awning 
while the others pulled down their hat brims 
and pretended not to be listening in. 
And Cavafy might have risen 
in a room like the one where I woke up 
to chalk-washed walls, two wicker chairs, 
and on a battered table, coffee 
and a single peach, newly sliced. 
But let us not go overboard. 
When I peered out the small window 
at the foot of the bed 
that offered the immensity of the Aegean, 
I did not see the sail of Odysseus at dawn 
rounding the island's volcanic corner 
and coming slowing but plainly into view. 
Cut them down 
or plant them in long rows tiger- 
striping a country lane, still they harbor 
hangnail shades, sighs of the dead: so were said 
to shoot up suddenly in the harshest soils, 
unsolicited, like any bird sprung 
from their useless fruit. Mourning tree, 
says Pliny: dowry for a daughter. Make me 
a poultice of leaves for the snakebite 
riding my ankle like an angry tattoo. 
For you who've gone missing 
in the vertical shadow, 
who knock hardhearted in the deadbolt trunk
salvo or echo, some bystander rage: sing me 
the password to your dumbstruck grief. 
Ring true. For every year hollowed out 
of blind disbelief 
another swings on its axis like high noon's curfew
an epoch of abscess, 
self-immolation. 
If we could take Pliny at his word, 
follow the sweep 
of Spartan shadow, trace hernia 
and sunstroke to their forgone source ... 
But nothing comes of it 
but miscalculation, nothing but axle-grease 
and bean meal for the swelling of the testes, 
laughter the keenest of medicinal gulls. 
Yet here they linger by the harbor, 
these cypresses, pressing whose lost 
sailor cause? Watch them ravage a hillside 
in Languedoc, bear the writ of mistral 
whiplash, scour the sky of its least adieu. 
To be topmast and sarcophagus both
to guard every graveyard 
with monastic glee: is that harm's way, 
or no harm done? It's the slow motion 
sickness gets you in the endyou born out of 
a thousand narrow escapes, breath 
too close to call. Spare me 
"They flood the pasture," my neighbor explained 
when we met this morning at the property line 
that divides his field from mine, which is also 
a meadow, although I call it a pasture 
when talking to him, since a meadow is not 
a place his cows would roam, but a patch 
of paradise for picnics and lovers. 
We had been walking around to see 
what damage winter had done to the fence 
and trees when we met at the marker and greeted 
each other, then broached the weather and other 
things regarding spring: the sap, 
its grade, its run, the snow, the herd, the beavers.
"They're heading this way as we speak,"
he said. "I saw them in a dream last night."
Spirits, I thought, come back to teach
the mysteries of building houses in water,
but nodded instead like a dashboard doll.
Elders in the ruse of beavers with a genius 
for damming, I wanted to tell him, 
but couldn't stop nodding in 
agreement with his denial of the fun 
he has each summer exploding their houses 
with TNT, then shooting them 
from behind a wall. "Pests," he called 
them, when he really meant such perfect 
moving targets for catching in the hairs 
of his .243. "Good luck," 
I said in a tone he didn't catch 
as I continued down the row 
of giant maples to the stream 
to see if I could find some sign 
of them, as I had in previous years
the prints of little hands in the loam 
and eaten trees, but nothing yet, 
just the cold, dark water of Sackett's 
Frank, we have become an urban species 
      at this moment many millions of humans are 
            standing on some corner waiting like me 
for a signal permitting us to go, 
      a signal depicting a small pale pedestrian 
            to be followed by a sea-green light 
we do not use this opportunity 
      to tune in to eternity 
            we bounce upon our toes impatiently 
It is a Thursday morning, Frank, and I feel 
      rather acutely alive but I need a thing of beauty 
            or a theory of beauty to reconcile me 
to the lumps of garbage I cannot love enclosed 
      in these tough shiny black plastic bags 
            heaped along the curb of 97th Street, my street
like a hideous reminder of the fate we all expect 
      letting the bulky slimy truth of waste
            attack our aesthetic sense and joie de vivre 
reliably every Thursday. Let me scan the handsome amber 
      columned and corniced dwellings 
            reflected in rear windows of parked cars, let me wish 
luck to their hives of intimacies, people 
      in kitchens finishing a morning coffee 
            saying see you later to the ones they live with 
Let me raise my eyes to the blue veil adrift 
      between and above the artifice of buildings 
            and at last I am slipping through a flaw in time 
where the string of white headlights approaching, the string 
      of red taillights departing, seem as if 
            they carry some kind of message 
perhaps the message is that one block west 
      Riverside Park extends its length 
            at the edge of Manhattan like the downy arm 
The feet, gladiator tridents, creeping up the sleeve of J.J. Kugh, 
               who stands implacably still. 
Adolescent, fearless, feathers a-bristle, he can afford to be clownish, 
               ascending the summit of Kugh's 
tattered deerstalker. & there he perches, a guffawing Mohawk-ed Buddha, 
               bill elongate and a-gleam, 
a dazzling cigarette boat from the pleasure fleet of William Randolph Hearst, 
               his only feature suggesting elegance. 
Feathers mottled, the red crest lost to Tanner's black & white Brownie, 
               eyes cartoonishly bulging. Now up Kugh's 
left shoulder, now to the back, slow crawl up the chest, where he pauses 
               to peck the buttons of Kugh's macintosh. 
Four thousand miles eastward, Neville Chamberlain sips tea with the Fuhrer, 
               their treaty & a fountain pen 
between them, Earl Grey spilling over to the saucer as it trembles in 
               the P.M.'s hands. But here, 
the auguries of apocalypse are small in scale. Tanner sets the Brownie 
               & his light meter on a stump 
& fumbles as he bands the bird's right leg,just above the starburst claw 
               & thus the feathered thing 
is also christened. He is Sonny Boy. His name is Sonny Boy. 
               & Sonny Boy lifts off 
to be sighted once again by Tanner two years later, a treetop above 
               a Louisiana swamp. The auguries 
of apocalypse. For instance, the Delta & Chicago Blues, their steady 
               chug & boogie toward extinction. 
On a stool on the stage of a club in Edmonton, Alberta, 1964, 
               sits the aging Rice Miller, 
a hulking human bomb, 6'4". Stage name: Sonny Boy Williamson, 
               harp raised to his lips, fingers quicksilver: 
Ain't got but one way out, babe, an' I jus' can't find the door, sweat 
               & slaver nimbusing the hieratic head. 
He sports a derby, purchased in London on his tour with the Yardbirds 
               & he loves his woman so hard
the lights don't burn bright no more. Later that night, it is bourbon 
               with Levon Helm & his Hawks, 
before Dylan, before their transformation to The Band. I would like 
               to say they are making music, but instead 
Sonny Boy pours another, spitting blood into a second cup
               scarcely a year to live. 
Who will know him in a century? In two? Whose pulse will quicken, 
               hair on the nape of the neck 
raised in awe & supplication as he growls of his beloved 
               bringing eyesight to the blind? 
O it's nine below zero an' she done put me down for another man. 
               The caterwauling harp, 
the amplified metallic slink. It paws the ground, baying at the moon. 
               It flies alone, it has no offspring. 
It calls to its mate, who is carcass & hollow picked bone. 
               Glorious this last transmission, 
the flight in mad careening circles, alighting above the muck & ooze 
               onto a lightning-blasted live oak, 
clawing up the mottled bark. & now the fervid spondees 
               of his cry, of his here-I-am. 
Caught mid-stride, taproots, tendrils shooting down 
from tripped toes like a mangrove straining 
an estuary, no part of Daphne 
touches ground, 
the downfall of her right foot loosening 
its ferocious calf-climbing bouquet of shade, 
her midriff trailing a bonsai glade 
which entails her pursuer, pierces his groin ... 
As sudden as a gust pales the poplar 
against encroaching sky, so he palms her waist, 
a look of bewilderment entering his face 
as his fingers find not skin but scar. 
From the blind side they've fled into abstraction, 
gone into the grove of themselves 
to hang on as vortices, selva 
oscura, a gnarled old thick-boughed oak ingrown 
Gone untrimmed, when the yield came down
perhaps Id think that I was rich
buckets and basins running over.
But all would be small: small blushed skin
small stiff coremaybe of no use
unless for pickling or stewing
or practising to split them open,
like a clasped book, with just my hands.
Twenty good apples on each good branch;
the pruning shears worked in the leaves
answering no and no again
until they cut away to a handful,
all green, and clinging to their stems;
the wind broke through the treeand maybe
I left it barer than I should
but this was where the thinning led:
I walk past Erin's house at dusk 
and there she is at her kitchen table, 
working on her book about the Reformation. 
She needs to finish it if she wants to get tenure, 
but it's slow going because being a single mom
is very difficult what with child care and cooking dinner 
and going in to teach her courses on the Reformation, 
which I can see her writing about right now, 
her face attractive yet harried in the glow 
of her laptop as she searches for le mot juste. 
Meanwhile Andrew, her nine-year-old son, 
shoots forlorn baskets in the driveway 
under the fatherless hoop bolted to the garage 
by the father now remarried and living in Dayton, 
as Andrew makes a move, a crossover dribble, 
against the ghost father guarding him, just as I did 
when I was nine, my daddy so immensely dead, 
my mother inside looking harried and scared, 
studying thick frightening books for her realtor's exam. 
And although I hardly know Erin, 
I feel I should walk up, knock on her door, 
and when she opens it (looking harried, 
apologizing for the mess) ask her to marry me. 
And she will smile with relief and say 
yes, of course, what took you so long, 
and she'll finish her chapter on the Reformation 
and start frying up some pork chops for us 
as I walk out to the driveway and exorcise 
the ghost father with my amazing Larry Bird jump shot, 
and tomorrow I'll mow the lawn and maybe 
build a birdhouse with the power tools slumbering 
on the basement workbench where the ghost 
father left them on his way to Dayton. 
Because I have wanted 
            to make you something 
beautiful, I borrowed 
            a book on how to keep 
a bee-hive made of glass. 
            An observatory 
of translucent arteries 
            lit with wing-gossip. 
An allegory for the soul. 
            Though what do I understand 
of beauty that thrives 
            in a place of exile. 
(Bees can anger so. 
            A grist of killers has swarmed 
a boy beneath the windowsill.) 
            You said the soul-to-be. 
Vegetables flower 
            outside. Squash-blossoms. 
& for what is that 
            an allegory? 
We live in a copy 
            of Eden, a copy 
By the River Baab
We know that somewhere far north of here 
the two rivers Ba and Ab converge to form 
this greater stream that sustains us, uniting 
the lifeblood length of our lands: and we believe 
that the Ba's source is heaven, the Ab's hell. 
Daily expeditions embark upcountry to find 
that fork, to learn where the merge first occurs. 
Too far: none of our explorers return. Or 
else when they reach that point they themselves 
are torn apart by a sudden urge to choose
to resolutely take either the Ba/the Ab, and trace 
good or evil to its spring. Each flips a coin 
perhaps, or favors whichever one the wind's 
blowing from at that moment. Down here 
even we who have not the heart to venture 
anywhere that would force us to such deep 
decisions, even we, when we hold that glass of 
water in our hand, drink it slowly, deliberately, 
as if we could taste the two strains, could somehow 
distinguish their twin flow through our veins. 
 
Knot (Hendecasyllabics)
You knock my socks off. I mean 
when I'm sitting on the grass 
I need my feet bare, and the inchworms
mulling the dirt of me, of you, I've carried 
in my pockets in my hair in my nails
I've heard there's not enough of you 
that soon I'll be through with you 
or I'm covered in stuff we call dark 
matter and the energy is pulling us through 
emptiness. The reason I'm here 
and you. From my balcony I hear 
construction workers singing on a rooftop, 
their hammers against wood, against nails.
I've felt Atlas carrying you 
the way I've carried 
love, the way I've carried my dead 
and buried them back to you, inchworms 
in the grass. I mean we're in the dark 
If I begin speaking to you now, you will have expectations 
You read me, as I read to you, and am read by you 
The problem with our reading is that, objectively, I do not control you 
You observe me as I walk my body to take my place here before you 
To me, you are here before me 
In this regard, we are at least tenuously set equal 
Whatever you expect me to say, I cannot fulfill it 
I speak for myself, and not for you 
Though, I am interested in the ideas and feelings I may subsequently cause 
        within you 
I am interested in the ways that my perception of your evaluation of me will 
        inform my sense of "identity" in the days to come 
I am interested in the various ways my performance (as it is a performance) 
        does not meet your expectations 
How did you hear my voice in your mind before you heard my voice? 
I am interested in what you think of me 
I want to solve the problem of the reading 
A more precise description is that I want to solve the problem of the power you
        momentarily inherit against me in the space of the reading 
There are many paths you have taken to arrive here, to be with me  
Part of the problem is my desire to honor the places you are not, and cannot 
        be, while you are here with me 
I have arrived here to be with you through a process of relaxing the guard 
        around my unfilled hours 
To give you the gift of unambiguous experience, I would say, "I am very happy 
        to be here," which is a part of the truth, as well as I can perceive it 
In equal truth it costs me to be here with you 
I see you wanting to give me the gift of your un-expectation 
I love you 
Death is at the door, the Reynolds Wrap 
blade of her scythe slightly bent, her mom 
on the sidewalk with a cup of warm beer. 
I worry about things I shouldn't
a pain in my knee, the stain on my shirt, 
that puddle of oil underneath the car. 
The trick is perspective, but it's tough 
to view the world as if from outer space 
while holding to your love for what's in it. 
At 2 a.m., drunk, I step outside. Orion 
hangs objectively above our dark house. 
I recline in the yard and count down. 
A jogger wakes me just before dawn, 
fearing I might be a corpse. I tiptoe 
up the stairs, hide out in my study. 
When I finally descend, no one 
seems to notice my pressurized suit 
or the crater I made on reentry. 
My wife eats leftover candy from the bowl. 
Our infant son teethes on a rubber skull. 
The neighbors dismantle their graveyard. 
Unfinished. Your lisps 
not yet wizened to 
wordsdry, erudite crinkling of your lips 
before you learned to dodge taxes, jostle 
into nylons, 
the chuff-chuff over hips. 
Youbanker with fattened knucklesor you 
librarian 
dithering through the stacks 
as if overseeing your own 
ward of loons. 
Beneath the tether of jowls 
                       loose and slack, 
I see your childhood faces, 
the sharp glint 
of belief. I want that reader 
         not you
pallbearer, staggering under the weight 
of dead love. 
What if it's only the two 
I never could find them, my cat's bones, 
though I know still they are somewhere near, 
laid beneath the hackberry we cut down 
to make room for the study we are building. 
I have tried, thinking less about my cat's 
attachments than my wife's, the unearthed grief 
that wanders our yard, looking for the new 
resting place and trees to give it shade. 
These days are long, and the parts we play 
lie down long before our bodies follow, 
so when she saw the tree taken from what 
was once our plan to take it, the loss seemed 
more clear and thus more difficult to see. 
I tried. And so broke ground like a promise 
around the holes that soon would turn to anchors, 
buckets of concrete to pin our floorboards down. 
I loved that cat the way a room loves a door 
that turns to sky each time it opens. Once 
we held her high and said that she was flying, 
pretended too to catch her purring body 
which we talked to constantly, pretending. 
She taught me, love is not quite empathy, 
however strong those roots in us, not quite 
what animal grace may or may not know. 
I never could find her, nor the broken doll 
that is her body, though I swore I stood there, 
and kept digging where I just was until 
everything went soft. Forgive me, cat, you 
who lie down in the wife who lies in me 
so deep no spade can find you. Hard for us 
1. 
When we had done our business with the lobster-man 
choosing our dinner from dozens of creatures packed 
in a fiberglass tank in his garage, their pincers pinched 
in plastic bands but all visibly sensible and frustrated, 
trampling each other in a muffled underwater passion, 
antennae desperate for a signal, mud-smudges and jet 
and startling crimson undercoats the color of pure fury 
curdling into fury proper when they were hoisted out 
through suffocating air, bodies in spasm, legs spindling
when we had done our business with the lobster-man 
he cast a quiet glance at the calm eggshell evening sky 
and said with the authority of God there would be fog 
so thick by morning we would not be able to make out 
our hands were we to raise them in front of our faces.

This is a migrant poem 
a farmworking poem, a poem that covers itself 
in long sleeves to avoid the burning sun. 
That drinks enough water to avoid 
dehydration but not enough to get water sickness. 
This poem carries a machete, a hoe, a spade, 
a knife, shears, and a file for filo. 
This poem walks irrigated rows collecting mud 
on its boots that add five pounds to each foot. 
This poem guards the cornfield where his sister, 
his mother, and his cousins, squat to pee. 
This poem ducks down hitting the dirt to avoid the 
echoing crop duster spraying anti-poem toxins that 
burn our eyes and throats. 
This poem is egg and chorizo burritos in aluminum foil, 
steamed shut by the heat waiting for you at lunch 
in a foam cooler in the trunk at the end of rows of soybean. This poem. 
This poem smells of bloodand meat. 
This poem flows from carcasses into open drains 
of slaughter houses, on kill floors, in chilled freezers 
with knives cutting, cutting, cutting, cuttingalways cutting. 
They duct tape knives into this poem's hands 
to cut even when its cut hands can cut no longer. 
This poem is a gift of a strong back, of sturdy legs,
of silence, of patience. 
And a never-ending work ethic 
           a never ending work ethic 
                       a never ending work of ethics. 
This poem shows you the bigger picture. 
This poem is pragmatic, strategic, and erratic. 
This poem reaches as it climbs ladders, as it stoops over, 
as it pulls from branches, vines, as it unearths other poems 
and tosses them into buckets and sacks slung across its stanzas. 
This poem is paid by the word, by the piece, 
by the hour, by the day, by the acre. 
This poem has no benefits, no days off, 
no health insurance, no childcare. 
This poem is child labor. This poem is sexual assault. 
This poem is deportation. This poem is missing wages,
broken vehicles, sunstroke. 
This poem avoids irrigation ditches where 
La Llarona hopes to drown it. 
This poem knows she commands water and sends waves 
of humidity and tempting mirages of cool rippling lakes. 
This poem wears a rosary and a scapular and prays to St. Francis of Assisi 
to protect them from snakes and rats that live in the fields 
and to St. Michael the archangel to protect them from the farmer's son 
who watches his sisters 
           who follows his sisters  
                      who pulls at his sisters. 
This poem wakes up early, works all damn day, sweats all damn day. 
This poem always needs a shower to wash off the dirt, to wash out the dirt, 
to wash away the dirt. 
This poem goes to bed early to do it all again 
                                                                         tomorrow. 
The Land Is Not Settled
The land is not yet settled 
After our years of pandemonium. 
This time it is almost too late 
To sing with full heart a parting hymn, 
Or indulge in the usual fickle 
Humour of things. It is too late 
To bolt the door of Ireland. 
A penny candle struggles in the wind, 
A corpse from the West rises 
To face me. What was a house now stands 
As a ghost from the assizes. 
Believe me, I tried to understand 
All the signals we received from Berlin. 
Little did they know, in our autonomous 
Region all the gold was gorse, 
And all investment was storytelling. 
Blackbirds in the oak trees are trembling still 
Where all our demons hurriedly went in. 
 
The Unexpected
        Looked for her in the 
unseenin the play of air 
        against the edge of 
        what appeared to be
a child's laugh in a neighbor 
        yard could recall her, 
        only to call her 
back into what had passedsought 
        her in dreams, but she 
        waited at one side 
in the not to be dreamed of 
        yet, neither asking 
        for hope nor giving 
it, not saying yes or no
        tried to step out of 
        the way, as she taught, 
to see if that would make it 
        simpler to be found
        felt she wanted to 
be held, even hold on to 
        the child she'd made, but 
        she wouldn't saywas 
it more blessed not to be 
        anyone, was that 
        the problem now, was 
she decidingtried praying 
        her across then, but 
Meltwater
A gang of foxes on the wet road, fur 
gaggle, the gutter a Ganges, gravel 
rutting the glacier's slur and cant. Old proof, 
the past can't solve itself, endlessly drawing 
its stung logos spirograph. You see 
the fox I cannot see; even the children 
can see her, vixen and her babies 
delicately picking their way along 
the white line of the tarmac, the rain 
rubbing out their shadows. I want you 
as I want water, rain crocheting moss 
from mist, sulfur on the pines' crooked limbs, 
hapless as the selkie who hums to herself
no one believes in her but there she is. 
 
Anxiety
Forces
It's different for the spiderweb: 
the only architecture 
in a five-block radius not 
undone by yesterday's tornado. 
Out at the More-4-Less, strands 
of uncooked spaghetti were driven, 
unbroken, like nails, through concrete. 
Different levels: different forces. 
I remember when Anna told me 
about the deep-sea dive that almost 
killed her, hammered and disoriented 
and tossed like debris in the middle 
of two converging vectors of power. 
That's what she said. The whales 
only knew they were singing 
to each other. 
 
Prosopagnosia
He looked up from the wormsthey'd kept him occupied 
for hours, burrowing, slithering through the mazes 
he'd construct from snips of wicker, and coiling 
their soily-pink confetti bodies so deftlyand now 
who were these faces peering in from the door ... oh 
it was Emma! whom he loved, it was Emma and two 
of the children, calling him to tea, and he followed them 
docilely and brimming with contentment to the table 
(there was jam!). It hadn't been clinical 
forgetting ... more the standard disorientation 
of any interdimensional wayfarer on arrival 
through the portal, back at his home world. After all, it 
had been hours (check out synonyms for "time": one 
is "betrayal"). And Darwin, after all, was often 
perplexed by his fellow homo sapiens; the pictures in his book 
on human facial expressions look a little like people, 
a little like cryptic hieroglyphs from a forgotten 
civilization. Think of Easter Island's rows of heads, 
staring at their infinity-point: planar and stoic 
and quarried from some Earth we've never walked on.

I've tried to keep my mother's face from erasure. 
The heart is a loyalist: it recycles. But the brain exists 
to store what's every-nanosecond new; the overlayering 
this implies is really another kind of abandonment. 
Or ask the famous dark side of the moon what it remembers 
of being in planetary utero, a part of the Earth: 
it has its own life now and moves in different circles. 
Even her face when I said "doggie" and went to pet 
the sewer rat? Yes. Her face at the end when the morphine 
turned its face away from hers? And when the oncologist said 
what he said? Her face at the start, my start, when the nurse 
first carried me out of infant ICU and into her bed? Yes, 
yes, and yesby which I mean no. A leaf is a cinch, 
a hummingbird is easy: their next is the same 
as their last. But humans ... Even humans of stone: 
the rain erodes Mt. Rushmore, and what used to be 
the mineral skin on the mineral face of a president 
is increasingly weather, year by year. The Sphinx. 
The "Ozymandias thing." Or my face, now, for you, 
here where it's pressed against my side of what 
the people in theater call "the fourth wall."

           didn't matter for once 
because we were flying. 
           The crows we were 
clothed in took a running 
           start for the gothic 
and that was all: 
           tooled doors opened 
and waxy air 
           lifted us on its current. 
And though the jeweled 
           light was dim we could tell 
the faces we were 
           seeing were beautiful, 
each with a mouth 
           and voice, and there was 
no doubt then, 
           as our chins and our rib cages, 
our wrists and our knees 
           rose, that what mattered 
was that we obey

the voices said,

Yesterday the talk was no clouds,
not a cloud to be seen, wont life
be great from here on out . . .
Overcast this morning. Half-light weighs down
the bricks and stones standing watch
over Dartmouth and Stuart.
In yesterdays light the cream façade
of New England Powers eleven stories
seemed lighter than air, lightly tethered,
as if the whole structure might float off
into the blue brilliance on the myriad
glass of the Hancock, which appeared
as a focusing lens held against the sky
but now juts from the ground, a monolith
of marine depths, profound viridian
wherein the Westin regards itself darkly.

So far all the perennials seem to have survived the winter, 
The bed of fennel retrenching itself in one showery stem. 
A mild run of days and I'm out here pulling up stakes,
Hoeing weeds whose roots reach down into frozen ground. 
 
ii.
March thawthe vultures on the updrafts like flakes of ash, 
The forsythia in their little haze of yellows by the road. 
Daffodils and lilacs. And just this morning, along the creek, 
I saw skunk cabbage, the dark mottled flames of their spathes. 
 
iii.
Again this year, underneath the awnings and latticed roofs, 
The seedlings are exhalations of the potting soil set out in flats 
At Chapon's. Snow Crown, Jade Cross, Golden Summer
My cart fills up, at twilight, with the names of the earth. 
 
iv. 
As if the darkness spilled from crevices of sweet green light, 
Two katydids, sheathed and translucent as leaves, 
Trill from perches on my bedroom wall. I lie awake listening 
To their bodies' crescendos. Tonight I don't have to sleep alone.

Crossing the sets of train tracks back from beside the river, 
I see how things go forward by twos: rails, ties, gravel beds, 
The first of the ox-eyes now blooming along the roadsides, 
The pincushion teasels within their collared whorl of spines. 
 
vi. 
Today I bedded the tomatoes in the shred excelsior of straw, 
Spread side dressings of compost, pinched off any side-shoots. 
A word peeked sometimes from the cave mouth
only to shuffle back, swallowed, sky-shy,
lost in his memorys russet Lascaux.
The great-granddaughter we set on his lap
played in the far-off, sunlit opening
of a tunnel ninety-one years long,
as noiseless, in spite of the hearing aid,
as a penny striking the floor of a well.
His eyes met ours like a groggy bears
as he pulled another stone into place
to seal the entrance to himself, to close
the senses that would not close themselves.
The poetry of earth is a ninety-year-old woman 
in front of a slot machine in a casino in California. 
She is wearing a gray dress, her sharp red lipstick 
in two lines across her mouth, put there 
by a daughter. Like Gertrude Stein's, her hair 
is cut close. Nearby is her wheelchair, painted blue 
like a boy's bicycle. It is a weekday in March, 
the casino is the size of a hangar that could house 
a dozen planes, but it is thousands of machines 
that fill the eye, an event of light and color. 
The sentences she now speaks are like the sentences 
of Gertrude Stein, without the ironies of art. 
Time is like a compressed accordion, the farthest 
points now near, more present than the present. 
Waiting, I am at the food court, reading a magazine 
article about the languages the world is losing. 
The languages spoken by a few remaining 
people. Or by one remaining person. Or lost 
totally, except for the grainy recordings in archives, 
mysterious as the sounds made by extinct birds. 
The reels on her machine spin, their symbols 
never matching. She is playing the one-cent slots, 
and her money will go far into the afternoon. 
And because waiting is thinking, I am thinking 
of the eternity Keats writes about in the sonnet 
about the grasshopper and the cricket, ceasing never 
          What's with you foreigners? We don't like that downer crap over here. 
Oh, wait, we do: when the Shangri-Las recorded "The Leader of the Pack" 
          in 1964, it shot to the top of the Billboard Hot 100, and not because 
Jimmy and his girl Betty rode off together on his motorcycle and lived
          happily ever after, either, since her folks were always putting him down 
(down, down) and saying he came from the wrong side of town, 
          so when she had to say goodbye, all she could do was cry, I'm sorry 
          I hurt you, the Leader of the Packeasy words to sing, surely, though 
getting all that pain across is another matter altogether, which is why, 
          before Jimmy rides off to get killed as lead singer Mary Weiss 
sings "Look out! Look out! Look out!" producer Jeff Barry has to psych her up 
          until she bursts into tears at the story of the tough biker 
who's really a softie at heart and the girl who somehow knows she'll never 
          see him again. Right now I'm the only customer in this restaurant, 
          meaning I have time to think that surely none of us is in favor of tragedy 
as depicted in "The Leader of the Pack," the best-known example 
          of the teenage road death song (also called "death disc" 
and "splatter platter"). But while on the surface it sounds like a song 
          for a girl audience, it's really a song for guys: masculine self-pity has
sold more records than any other emotion. Mainly, it's about 
          thwarted love, and every member of every audience has felt that. 
          I sip coffee and think, they like to cry, the people. To them, sorrow is a drug 
or pharmakon, as the old Greeks had it, both remedy and poison, like 
          alcohol, which makes us happy but then stupid, or football, which builds 
characteryou get knocked down, you get back upyet scrambles our brains. 
          Poet Erica Bernheim says,"I would like motorcycles so much better if they 
didn't exist." You could say the same for thwarted love, yet who among us 
          has not had his or her heart broken, and who does not think that he or she 
          is a much better him or her as a result of that experience, even though 
he or she didn't especially enjoy it at the time? According to Blake, 
          "If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man 
as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' 
         narrow chinks of his cavern." Maybe foreign movies are right to end unhappily. 
Is Jimmy going to sweep Betty up and marry her and have a bunch 
          of greaser kids and start a successful chain of motorcycle sales 
Standing before his boss, his clipboard clutched 
Tightly against his chest as though it might be 
The breastplate of some long-outdated suit 
Of armor, strangely small and thin, he listens 
While from the howling suckhole of a face 
He's recently begun to recognize 
In dreams, whole gales of imprecation swell 
The room, balloon it, till the walls themselves 
Seem stretched, tensed, straining not to fly apart 
While words as imprecise as musket balls 
Go burring through the air. He tells himself, 
Nothing can touch me, nothing in the world 
Can move me, centers, breathes the three deep breaths 
He's read about in books by Buddhist monks, 
And stares above and slightly to the left 
Of all that raddled, gaping, goggle-eyed 
Absurdity and at a beautiful 
Framed watercolor of a famous dodo, 
Its head shaped wrong, its rump ridiculous, 
The bulge where neck meets body most suggestive 
On a day of windy transition, one season to the next, 
you spoke of helping your mother close her house, 
of the choices you had to makewhat to discard, 
what to keepas if it were your childhood itself 
waiting to be plundered. You kept a Persian rug, 
all reds and golds, to walk on every day, 
keeping the past alive under your feet; 
those nested Russian dolls you played with 
as a girl: grandmother, mother, daughter; 
four bentwood chairs wrenched now from their table. 
I listened, thinking I'd be next to try 
to crowd a lifetime of things 
into a shrinking universe of boxes. 
I've started to dismantle my life already, throwing 
out letters from people I remember loving, 
choosing among booksthis one to stay, 
that one to goas if I were a judge 
sentencing some to death, the rest 
to the purgatory of the emptying shelf.
Perhaps I should simply burn it all. 
Hiphole 
As far as the hiphole, every night I dug 
into the dirt so I could put my body 
partly underground on my long walk from 
Lake Garda to Venice and thence to Bologna 
and then third class to Florence, for the body 
on either side can't rest on a flat surface, 
say a wooden floor, but when we slept in 
trees we must have slept facedown on top of 
a branch and locked our hands to keep from falling 
especially if we moved too much in our sleep 
for we were monsters then and led alternative 
lives with leopard skin of sorts and powerful 
tails not to mention sharp teeth for cutting 
and jaws for ripping and bird-like claws for holding 
on and sometimes for piercing and sometimes just for 
flea abatement or simply musing and scratching, 
though we had holes too in the crowded forest 
close to our trees, surrounded by our bushes, 
for we lived mostly in the understories 
and that way we left our lakes for distant cities 
or what we took for cities then, the thought 
was still with us when we were eating 
mortadella and warm tomatoes and washing 
our faces at the spigots stopping in 
the Romanesques to look at the renderings; 
we already knew the routes, we had our knapsacks 
packed with toothbrushes, dictionaries, sweaters, 
and Swiss knives, though we still walked on our knuckles. 
 
Blue Jay 
At least I am luckier than that blue jay
hopping along the bulwark 
his rubber leg falling back under him 
absolutely doomed, the way it is out there. 
My heart goes out to him 
though he's more a bully than 
any other warm creature that came my way. 
I never thought I'd plead for a blue jay 
I who haven't pled for seventy years, 
I who got on my knees every night 
to go through the ritual of my own devising. 
Where wed recently lain,
exchanging a kiss,
stork consorted with crane, 
            limpkin with ibis.
Was this as much wedding
as there would ever be,
the fowls foot-webbing,
            the identificatory
ring around a throat?
Exchange of earth and air:
not a vow but a vote
            of confidence a feather
might tip by a single scale ...    
That ones a raconteur,
so much salt in his tale;
            this ones a countertenor,
lilting above the feast.
The archon of his hectare
  spotted  spotted least.
            Heres a little heckler ...    
so his life snapped back, a bough 
pulled down then released 
         into the dusk, 
unearthing a sound in the air 
that had always been 
inaudibly in motion 
I turn towards the sound
                  watch it drifting 
in my brother 
Hiding your face in my neck 
and hiding your hands in my hair 
hiding your lips on my lips 
to stop the words before I speak 
hiding in the space around 
the space I have dressed you in 
wings of hardened spirit. 
Angelot, a new day is here, 
With his ripe face like one of those pale freckled pears 
you hold in your hand and his mind shuddering across it 
like a bruise  hes legible to all the world. With his great legs, 
broad and strong as the trees, he walks in and out of chapters 
smelling of eau de cologne, or an animal that sleeps in a barn. 
With his long fingers running across the stubble on his jaw, 
he listens to the black Russian rain before he picks up his pen. 
With his eyes so blue youd think hed drunk the sky down 
with all that champagne, he watches the soldiers (red epaulettes 
and high boots) drag that boy to the place where they shoot him. 
He watches the boy pull his loose coat tight before he sags and slides 
down the post. And when its all over, he watches them roll him 
Memorial Day weekend,
the lake is thronged
with boats and jet skis,
memorys water walkers.
Hes lost count of the drownings.
                                 *
Its all down there,
tobacco fields, the old homeplace,
cross-cut saws, creek stones
that marked unnamed graves,
woodstoves and chicken coops,
spinning wheels and chestnut cradles
and coffins,
the old rugged cross
and all the yellowed almanac hokum.
                                 *
After the first frost,
he found a hornets nest
latched to a low limb,
which meant a mild winter.
He brought it in and spent hours
peeling off the gray whispering layers.
It was a kind of translation,
unweaving the work
of so many mouths.
At the core of the nest
was the comb
with its tiny pharaohs entombed.
What to do now
with this pile of paper,
too delicate to accept
even the slightest mark?
The ancient blank text
kept mum.
                                 *
The barn was his get-gone.
Long empty
and beginning to shed siding,
it still smelled of harness and hay,
of long field hours brought in.
Mud daubers had hung their clay flutes
just under the eaves.
Swallow nests tufted the rafters
and the swallows carved the dusk.
This was the use of disuse.
Loft, grain bin and stall
organized the silent dimness.
One summer, he found a litter
of kittens in the manger.
Five fur blots,
eyes squeezed shut, wriggling.
A day or two later
their limp stillness.
A tom had neatly slit each throat.
                                 *
Six years old, he went with her
to decorate the church
for Christmas, clapboard Baptist,
sanctuary like a barn.
Her parents had given the land to the faithful,
though they had precious little land.
They had to wait for another woman to come.
She had the Virginia creeper
theyd wind around the white candles
in each sanctuary window.
They sat in the front pew and waited.
It was cold and they kept their coats on.
It was the best sermon hed ever heard,
the tall silence of the empty place,
the smell of talc in her old coat
and when the grumbling basement furnace
finally kicked on, some dust leapt up from the vents
and danced around the pulpit.
                                 *
After a weeks visit,
he finds, on the nightstand,
a mound where his daughter
peeled her sunburn,
a small pyramid of skin.
                                 *
He was to be paid
a penny per thistle.
He was to keep count.
The swing blade said, tsk, tsk
like a frowning grandmother.
By noon his hands
were blistered.
His arms that night
would remember the swinging blade.
He lost count sometime
in the afternoon.
How many thistles
could a pasture hold?
It was a riddle
from a sphinx.
The purple blooms
on the spikey stalks
were plundered by bees,
honey for the combs.

They troll for a drowning
with a grappling hook,
though the body,
once it bloats, will rise.
Its a courtesy Search & Rescue
does for survivors,
taking some action for the living.

When the power company exec explained
what they would be paid for the land
to be under water then left
in a black Lincoln Continental
his father said,
I reckon theres nothing to be done about it,
just have to live beside it.
All the old thinking will be underneath.
Even his way in words
would be drowned.
                                 *
The boys on the stand-behind mowers
glide over the hillside across the cove.
He doesnt speak their language.
They dont speak his.
But they know grass.
They cross-hatch the green
and glide like a stately procession
of jackal-headed gods across papyrus.
                                 *
The dam was sealed
the year he was born.
A monument to human
engineering, the paper said.
Sometimes at dusk
he stands on the bank
and thinks, You and me,
lake, were the same age
and what we have
we have underneath.
                                 *
The troll boats are out again,
dragging their grappling hooks.
Someone has come up missing.
Thats the story of our lives, he thinks.
Theyre half throttle
as they work a grid
in what has no grid,
the big cave of the water.
He wonders if the two drowned rivers
are still moving, still sliding
in their beds beneath, water under water.
Dusk in its shepherd cloak
is walking out.
Search & Rescue calls it a day.
The hooks come up without their man.
Cicadas sing like the shrill of the depths.
                                 *
There was the store with the screen door,
the man with three days growth of beard,
always. How did he do that? Never clean-shaven.
And the fat woman with her pencil stub
and brown paper bags she totaled up tabs on.
The oiled wooden floor cried
for the pacing of this or that,
what could be done without.
                                 *
Moses in a basket floating
in the bulrushes.
What were bulrushes?
He clipped the picture
with the safety scissors.
His Sunday School teacher
said there werent any bulrushes
in the mountains.
Everything miraculous
happened somewhere else.
                                 *
After watching the news at noon
he goes out to the shop
to work on the weedeater.
He puts the shaft in the vise
and starts to tinker.
The carburetors gunky.
He thinks about his shifts at the mill,
the banked hours he lives on now.
The shops tin roof ticks.
His daughters live in other states.
Glass baby food jars of saved nuts and washers
line the dusty shelves.
                                 *
The bed was one of two strangenesses
in the house.
It was an odd contraption,
too big for the bedroom and chrome-shiny,
out of place under the stiff, yellowed portraits
of a man and woman he didnt know.
She rested there,
the bed cranked up part way.
She was an old queen on her throne,
eyes shut, with a difficult choice to make.
His fathers father
spent the afternoons with his head bowed
over the Bible or a baseball game
on the crackling Philco.
Clouds slid their shadows
through the windows
as if great fish passed quietly overhead.
                                 *
Live beside it.
What hes done for fifty some years.
On paper hes wealthy.
The summer people slide by,
oiled bodies in pleasure craft,
gunning of a torqued engine.
The busy gray nest
swallows hornets like words
returning to the mouth.
                                 *
Summer afternoons he read.
There was nothing else to do.
Too hot to ride his bike.
Tales of empires, great kings.
From the porch
he watched the old red hay baler
making its rounds
in the field behind his grandfathers
ruin of a barn.
His father rented the field
to a man who raised beef cattle.
The square bales dropped
from the balers chute.
The field was being organized
into neat blocks.
Its what we do, he thought,
arrange the grass, make stacks.
At the fields edge
the rising water shimmered.

Map to the Stars 
A Schwinn ride away: Eagledale Plaza. Busted shopping 
strip of old walkways, crooked parking spaces nicked 
like the lines on the sides of somebody's mom-barbered 
head. Anchored by the Piccadilly Disco, where a shootout 
was guaranteed every weekendcoughing stars shot from 
sideways guns shiny enough to light the way for anyone 
willing to keep a head up long enough to see. Not me. 
I bought the star map shirt for 15¢ at the Value Village 
next to the Piccadilly. The shirt was polyester with flyaway 
collars, outlined in the forgotten astronomies of disco. 
The shirt's washed-out points of light: arranged in horse 
& hero shapes & I rocked it in places neither horse nor hero 
hung out. Polyester is made from polyethylene & catches 
fire easily like wings near a thrift-store sun. Polyethylene, 
used in shampoo bottles, gun cases, & those grocery sacks 
skidding like upended stars across the parking lot. There 
are more kinds of stars in this universe than salt granules 
on drive-thru fries. Too many stars, lessening & swelling 
with each pedal pump away from the Value Village 
as the beaming billboard above spotlights first one DUI 
attorney, then another who speaks Spanish so the sky 
is constantly chattering, like the biggest disco ball ever. 
 
Outta Here Blacks
As soon as Mom married Pops: 
        off to the suburbs, realm 
        of glamorously blue 
        swimming pools, carpools 
& a spinning rack of comic books 
out front at the Village Pantry. 
& we were out of Carriage House 
like kids as soon as math sub 
        turns his back. 
        We were out like juice 
boxes after lunch. 
        We were on the West Side
nowhere near our old neighborhood
like a well-organized poverty protest. 
No moving truck because 
we didn't have anything 
        to move out. 
        We were so out of there 
        I had to dial long distance 
to tell Garrett we'd gone. 
We were outside our chalk-outlined 
        piece of town like a bad pitch. 
We were outlying that old spot 
        like perfectly spelled 
gentrifications. We were as out 
of bounds as the how & why
of black kids with two 
        white parents now. 
        Desegregation out here. 
I got some ice cream out here 
like an Eddie Murphy impersonation 
        at the watercooler. 
        We were as uncomfortable 
as a black joke in our air-conditioned 
My white cloth by candlelight is your white cloth by candlelight 
I remember a meal the covenant once served me 
My violin is your violin 
The rain of the land in its season 
Witness, set out 
I rub the door post where the mezuzah held its prayer
A prayer is a tiny camera 
My former rain is your latter rain 
My latter rain is your former rain 
My white breath with your white breath 
So, our days may be multiplied 
At childhood's gate, a snake 
In the act of swallowing 
A toad, legs first 
Transfixed, we watch until 
The one looks out of the other's mouth 
Where we go the covenant follows 
I came to in the middle of the pasture. 
Rain ticked against the tractor's hood and steam 
coiled above the chassis. Thunder plowed 
into the distance where the clouds obscured 
the day's remaining light. 
                                          It was a Sunday. 
I'd preached on perseveranceon Paul's thorn
and, afterward, had hoped to mow the thistle 
before the storm. I don't recall much more 
than that: only the distant scent of rain, 
the way the thistle sloughed its seed beneath 
the blade, the hackles rising on my neck 
before the strike I also don't recall. 
Before that afternoon, I'd often answer 
when asked about my calling, how I'd known
Some men are drawn to heaven. Others heaven 
won't leave alone. 
                               And so, I stay indoors. 
I count in Mississippis the slow seconds 
between retreating thunders, skim the last 
chapters of Revelation to forget 
the trying absence of that pasturetime 
I lostuntil I finally nod off ... 
But even in my sleep I see the pasture. 
In the persistent dream, I'm looking out 
the attic dormer, where, beyond the fence-line, 
a narrow stand of longleaf pines sways 
under the gathering cloudswhen, only just 
before I turn away, a bright shank strikes 
the tallest of the farthest trees. 
                                                  It leans 
and since I am removed, behind the glass, 
since all is still, it falls in utter silence. 
Who knows the awful mind of our creator? 
I've seen that pine fall every night since then, 
and every night I fail to hear the voice 
inside that quiet. 
                             But what is there to hear? 
I'm through with prayer. Please don't misunderstand. 
I only mean to say that had you woke 
like me, nameless and shivering in the rain,
you might consider what you're asking for
the steep price of briefly becoming light. 
Denial is not a river in Egypt
says my t-shirt, once Dads.
But it is, with its crocodiles and palms,
and all the answers flying this way,
little vanilla egrets low over the water,
over the banked crocodiles snoozing
in the long self-sharpening shadows
which fall also on a table for one, on a balcony
overlooking a fork in my river in Egypt.
I have a perfect view of the place where one river
becomes two, as if a mirror could be divided,
or a wishbone split itself.
Denial splits the mind, making one part
invisible to the other.
The two are strangers when they
sit next to each other on the train
On the road to Taos, in the town of Alcalde, the bronze statue 
of Juan de Oñate, the conquistador, kept vigil from his horse. 
Late one night a chainsaw sliced off his right foot, stuttering 
through the ball of his ankle, as Oñate's spirit scratched 
and howled like a dog trapped within the bronze body. 
Four centuries ago, after his cannon fire burst to burn hundreds 
of bodies and blacken the adobe walls of the Acoma Pueblo, 
Oñate wheeled on his startled horse and spoke the decree: 
all Acoma males above the age of twenty-five would be punished 
by amputation of the right foot. Spanish knives sawed through ankles; 
Spanish hands tossed feet into piles like fish at the marketplace. 
There was prayer and wailing in a language Oñate did not speak. 
I cannot talk about the place I came from 
I do not want it to exist 
The way I knew it 
In the language of my captor 
The keeper asks me why I 
Refuse him this 
I think to anyone who came from / The place I came from 
It would be obvious 
but     / / I did not think my people 
Superior to other people    before 
The keeper's language has infected me 
I knew of     / / Few people 
Beyond the people / I knew 
before and when I met new people
The first thing I assumed was 
they were just like me 
Perhaps even relatives 
Who had before my birth been lost 
In the jungle or on the plain 
Or on the other side of the mountain 
And so at first I thought the white men    / Were ghosts 
one spoke my language 
And said that he had spoken to my father 
I did not fear them 
I thought they had been 
whitened by the sun    / Like bones    wandering 
I thought I could / Help them 
I thought they didn't

Moving fast, the eye 
works it out that 
they're a couple, he 
reaches out to 
touch her cheek, no, 
to take her cellphone.

From down the block 
hard to tell a 
spill of trash from 
a sleeping man 
until the eye, 
the quick, patient 
eye sorts it out, 
sorts it all out, 
the parts, the fit.

Woman comforting an injured 
dog, the caption the morning 
after the tornado says, but 
if you click for the bigger 
picture, the text changes to 
woman comforting an injured 
and dying dog. It's the same 
image, enlarged and without 
hope, unless you count 
the act of kneeling beside 
the dying, unless you keep 
your eye trained on the woman's 
hand gentling the dog's 
breakage, unless you believe 
there's something like a soul 
capable in high winds of 
A minuscule bird 
clinging to a twig 
is shredding a loop 
of knotted string 
to a fibre-fuzzy 
mist in its bill, 
a haze as soft 
as cotton wool 
with which to line 
a nest no bigger 
than this small cup 
I lift to my lips 
while I wait for you 
in this little coffee shop

We were rich. In the dark valley
the highway formed a pavé river 
and down in the orchestra pit 
the players were clothed in our 
sustaining contributions. 
Our portfolios swelled and contracted 
inside digital rib cages 
and that silent breathing 
was the breathing of a spirit that's 
beyond you. When we left, 
our houses filled with security
mute and clear, like still water. 
When we returned, that presence 
withdrew into our secret codes. 
All summer long, a mist 
rose off our lawnsI'm sure 
you'd say like steam resurfacing 
from a buried nineteenth century. 
(It was recycled water, 
on a timer, for the grass.)

We were the rich. We glimpsed the poor 
smoking dumbly on their stoops, 
lugging gas cans to their drained vehicles. 
We filled their televisions 
as though we were 
fictional characters. We recalled 
their revolutionary songs, we could see 
how they coveted our luxury hybrids. 
They looked up to us, you know, 
with the blankness of a field 
of tiny flowers. When they agitated, 
it was like a breeze 
out of nowhere passed across 
their surface. That trembling was lovely 
when observed from a distance. 
In a minute it would stop.

But our lives, too, were visited 
by elemental tragedies: deaths of parents, 
illnesses of children, fires 
that absolutely failed to light. Poet
with your miniscule economy 
simply no one understands
I know what you'll say: your art 
was there for us, and yes, it was. 
More importantly, in those moments 
of terror and empty, useless grief 
our primary need 
was sympathyreal sympathy 
Balsamic, for Zhenjiang vinegar. 
Letters, for the family gathered. 
A Cuisinart, for many hands. 
Petty burglars, for warring bands. 
A baby's room, for tight quarters. 
Passing cars, for neighbors. 
Lawn-mower buzzing, for bicycle bells. 
Cod fillets, for carp head-to-tail. 
Children who overhear the language, 
for children who speak the language. 
Virginia ham, for Jinhua ham, 
and nothing, for the noodle man, 
calling as he bears his pole 
down alley and street, its baskets full 
of pickled mustard, scallions, spice, 
minced pork, and a stove he lights 
where the customer happens to be, 
the balance of hot, sour, salty, sweet, 
She was four years old when she told me 
the children at her daycare had been arguing 
over which was greater, infinity (pronounced 
"finity") or the last number. 
Sometimes we're speechless because we deserve to be. 
Sometimes love leaps out beyond enumeration 
or the vast, starry spaces in the skull of time. 
With a secret, satisfied smile, she said, almost to herself, 
"Jeremy says it's the last number, but we really know 
it's finity." 
And now she has gone like a sprite 
into the genius of her answer, leaping every number, sailing 
into the endlessness of that smile, and left us 
plodding knee-deep in starless equations 
in which X equals loss, again and again 
and again, to the nth power. 
Jesus said our days are numbered. 
Hermes Trismegistus said numbers were the secret words 
by which the world and heavens told each other 
what would ever be. 
And now we say a thing that matters 
"counts." 
And when it stops counting it is dross. 
We say to measure is to know 
and to know is to possess. But love 
burns without consuming and weighs nothing, 
like faith, 
like a fool's precision or the dream of a memory 
of a child's face. 
I fold two and carry one in each hand 
among the small groups of people still talking, 
although most have left the room. I lean the chairs 
on ones already upright against a wall 
or lower them atop a horizontal pile. 
Two of these chairs at a time 
are easily manageable, so back at the empty rows, 
I fold three and haul them with both hands 
across the space. Next trip I try 
four: fingers on each hand curved 
under the metal backrests of 
two chairs. Fifty years 
of unstacking and arranging them (centre aisle 
or not, straight lines or semicircle), 
then clearing them. Anti-war event, 
community protest meeting, union meeting, 
address by a notable or activist figure 
in a cause I endorse, or by a novice 
or veteran writer, or panel involving 
three speakers. Fractious debates, or 
readings or talks I can hardly stay awake through 
chair after chair after chair: 
my twenties, forties, seventies. Other volunteers, 
fellow members, friends of friends helping, 
and now the tables used by the presenters 
at the front, or to collect tickets at the door, 
must be tilted on one edge, the slide that locks the legs 
released, and these flattened against 
the table's underside before two of us hoist it 
toward a storage closet. Or if the tables 
don't weigh that much, I grasp one of the metal rails 
underneath that stiffen the top, 
elevate it from the floor myself 
and walk. The heavy risers, though, 
that formed the temporary stage 
must be detached from each other, 
then two of us position a riser vertically, 
one-two-three heave 
and we're bearing it toward a cart 
that is eventually filled, pushed 
toward a storeroom. 
An Age 
Jackself is staying in 
today, like a tool in a toolbox, 
to try to just be 
     high in the lovely lofts 
of Lamanby 
he stands at a cracked 
window watching the gulls 
flash and snap, like washing on a line 
     in the pale heat 
the wormy heartwood floorboards 
swell and creak 
     he stands for an age 
               not for a dark age, 
not for an ice age or an iron age, but for a 
pollen age, when bees 
browsed the workshops 
of wildflowers for powder 
of light, and the cables 
of a spider's web were dusted with gold 
by the unreceptacled breeze 
 
Plantation 
Jackself's chinning 
into the near-dark north wind 
and feels it drawing silver thorns 
from the corners of his eyes            he hunches 
deeper into his parka, 
deeper into his lion's mane 
hood        I'm in the wilderness        no, he says, 
I am the wilderness, where stray 
greyhounds, scrawny prophets 
and secret-keepers walk cold acres 
hunting shelter under a welder's 
mask moon, motherless 
and fatherless, with no cupboard of sweetcorn 
and baked-bean tins, no airtight 
canisters of shortbread 
     no baubles, no toilet paper, no featherbed 
          what would a turned-out 
greyhound want with baubles and toilet paper 
For years, I'd begged him for the smallest word. 
Finally I cursed him with the worst I knew. 
Silent skies. Maybe it was true, 
and he never was? But then I heard 
his breath behind my own; even in his sleep 
he brooded on the form my hell might take. 
So I forgave him. O that shook him awake
he raged and howled; then he began to weep. 
There's however it is you call, 
& there's whatever it is 
you're calling to. 
July, I sew 
my own dress 
from calico & lace. 
August, they take it 
off me in the Colony, 
trade it in 
for standard-issue 
Virginia cotton. 
Not much room 
for my body in the 
heavy slip; maybe 
that's the idea. 
 
                                For awhile the abandoning 
                                was rare & then it was not 
                                & would never be again. 
 
                                Imagine you are 
                                an animal in your 
                                own throat. 
 
The dormitory has a pitched 
dark roof & a high porch. 
We are not allowed outside. 
Instead, we go to the window & make 
a game of racing dogwood blossoms 
knocked down by the wind. 
Choose your flower as 
it falls & see whose 
is the first to hit the clay. 
I beat the crippled girl every day 
for a week. The trick is to pick 
the smaller petals. 
 
                                Most nights, they knot 
                                the bed sheet in my mouth 
                                so I will not bite my tongue. 
 
                                Lay out on the pine floor: 
                                rattle your own bones back 
                                to the center of the world. 
 
In the beds, the smell 
of kerosene & lye. 
The girls wake themselves 
one after another: 
spasm, whimper, whine. 
Outside: cicadas. 
In the distance: the bighouse lights. 
Another truck comes loud up the road 
bearing another girl. 
It's quiet like that. Bucolic. 
Looks like nothing's going wrong anywhere at all. 
Bare trees rocking back and forth. Three crows 
chasing an owl across the field into the woods. 
Yesterday, men appeared at the top of the drive
rifles, orange vests, big boots, at the same moment 
dog ran at them barking and a 350 ton C-5 Air Force 
cargo plane grazed us all. Its 200 foot wingspan at tree top, 
the noise of it making each of us hold his or her 
breath for a moment. Dog didn't bite the men. 
Men didn't shoot dog; plane didn't crash. 
Of course they were puzzled by the woman shouting 
from the doorway of the house. 
It's true, the tree has the scent of the sea, 
         but the silver leaves, their slender fingers, 
the thick, infinitely twined trunk, some riddle 
         in the roots that lets it drink from the stones, 
even the place where a limb has broken or 
         been lopped off, the shoot that springs back 
to life, stumps that burn for hour upon hour, 
         a scattered discard twig you press to your lips, 
and the fruit that hangs from young branches 
         and old, a green reddening to black, this fruit 
ripened on enough bloodshed and hardened 
         human behavior to make you think it will turn 
Bone-ache signaled growth, 
height a sure thing. 
Hiccups? The lungs' desire 
to fulfill their contract with the body. 
Stubbed toe, throbbing funny bone, 
leg of pins and needles
even a toothache, a blessing: 
"If it hurts, it's not dead." 
Any pain better than none, better 
than the nerves' apathy. 
And so she bubbled with laughter 
when the car window closed 
on my fingers or a camera swinging 
from her chest clocked my forehead 
Hall of Famer Frank Thomas, from 1990 to 2005, 
hit 448 home runs over the fence for the White Sox 
with the notorious Robert Taylor Homes standing just 
beyond ballpark grounds across the Dan Ryan Expressway: 
the high-rises, bruises against the city-flag-blue sky, 
eyesores. When the last tower came down, I don't remember 
the president, the mayor or any other politician standing 
in front of the rubble with a megaphone vowing to get 
the ones who did this; incrimination isn't done quite so 
publicly here, plus a project is a project is a project. 
Whenever folks rolled to Comiskey, they saw those towers 
and thought of G-Baby from Hardball, comedic little black boy 
baseball player shot outside a building that looked sort of 
just like those; Keanu Reeves's character was kind of torn up 
about the whole thing. Good riddancetheir one Red Line 
train of thought, tears in their blue and green eyes. Hood 
riddance, too. As we drive past, I glimpse the ghost of my young 
face in the car window, overlaying the empty lot with reflection. 
It's a place where many people died but many, many, many more 
lived. Those are the folks I identify with: I know what it's like 
She met me at the fence. A kelpie 
who'd stayed too long in this horse form, 
she mouthed the sugar on my palm, 
and when I slapped her barrel flank 
the goose moor stiffened with a sea 
perfume. Gulls gathered on the stoop. 
Santorini
Mother of Stone, Cybele, 
Stone Mother, keep me low, 
Resigned, involved, confusable 
As to the novice eye the vine 
With wild thyme and caper, close 
To your chemic soil—
Ash, tuff, and pumice—twined 
In on itself to stand 
Up under summer wind 
And to condense the sure, sheer mist 
That plumps until night harvest 
Grapes tanged with sulfur, pressed 
Then to a salt-tinged must, 
Oak barrel ready, 
A touch acidic, wit-dry, heady. 
 
Psalm on Sifnos
One does not want, 
O Lord, to heap 
Up by still waters 
Of words a cairn 
But hopes to attend 
A small covert 
Of tamarisk 
Whose leaves salty 
Yet feathery 
Will shed light over 
The thickened plot. 
At the base of a leg
of smoke 
      on which the heaven of Los Angeles 
      stands, a man 
is burning 
the unidentified remains 
      of a chair 
      in a can, and his shadow 
grows tall 
against the warehouse wall 
      behind his eyes. 
      Another man joins him, 
and in the distance you 
hear a siren, 
      a dog, 
      and then another, 
and the whispered sea of the interstate 
coming ashore. 
      In other words 
      a kinship of silhouettes 
and voices 
falls over the talk and inner lives 
      of those who otherwise might appear 
      left out 
of the larger conversation. 
I read once 
      fire came to the center 
      of our social circle 
for this: before it cooked our meats 
it held 
      our fascination. It held us. 
      And then the howling, 
and a man shares a hit 
of smoke 
      with a man swept 
      with the others from the center 
of town. 
The new money is buying 
      up the old 
      and the rents that sweep 
beds from these apartments, 
and the mission 
      is full, 
      and the flames keep breaking 
some local ordinance 
to pieces 
      like a chair. 
      Just today the one man sat 
through a sermon 
in a parking lot 
      because it came with coffee 
      and a roll 
and a city of angels 
that had no suffering. 
      Only strangers 
      to their experience 
on earth. 
It felt like a story told 
      over the fire. 
      The stars taking aim 
among the copters with their needles 
of light. 
      Something in the sermon's voice rose 
      with a clarity 
foreign to smoke. 
It helps some. The coffee 
      is hot. 
      And the new money keeps burning 
a hole in the pockets 
of Los Angeles 
      where land is cheap and people 
      move along 
a step ahead of the law and the seasons. 
Welcome to paradise, 
      says the postcard of a beach 
      in the fire. 
And as it crumples, nothing 
changes. 
      Nothing moves an address 
      like that, 
where the streets are swept each morning 
by machine. 
      There is a better world, 
      surely, 
and the darkness of the warehouse wall 
ebbs a little 
      as the ashes rise. 
      Whatever the medication, it is always 
wearing off. 
Whatever the angel 
      dust that falls from the construction, 
      power is always 
hungry, thin, 
gone the way of white powders 
      in the high rise 
      and the air above the earth movers 
coming to rest. 
Any pretense here of the whole 
      picture 
      gives way to the perspective 
of a man or two. 
Beside the empty warehouse, 
      words and silences get exchanged 
      like cash 
buying cash, 
and the larger conversation 
      is less a conversation 
      then the ghost of elsewhere 
thumping in a black 
limousine, 
      the windows the mirror of our own 
      exclusion. 
One's own hand could be shaking 
for some 
      unspoken reason. 
      One man could hear the siren spread, 
dog to dog, and laugh 
with another, 
      and what the hell. 
      Time to put the whole enchilada 
in, 
the chair and the missing man 
      it held, 
      the leg with its claw, 
the arm 
curved like a broken overpass. 
      Time 
      for the part that never was a chair. 
It is now. 
Fire makes it so 
      and so mails the postcard back 
      to where it came from, 
to St. Peter 
at the electric gate, 
      beyond the local ordinance that is the space 
      around a heaven, 
that keeps it safe. 
Put it in, 
      the angel and the machine and the ball 
      that drops 
through the wall of the tenement, 
the bright flock 
      that scatters like a window. 
      Put them all in, 
the way a dog puts it all 
in the cry 
      we call his, 
      though something the size of the whole 
picture 
is happening to him, 
      echo untouched by echo, 
      throat by throat
something of the whole heart 
cut out 
      of hiding, the deep red part 
      hurled into the dark 
like meat 
to the wall, 
Cow parsley is of child height 
      and hemlock is a giant. 
Above the barley, wheat and corn 
      hemlock stands defiant.
cow parsley stalks have a groove like the groove 
in a stick of celery where the peanut butter goes. 
Hemlock has a smooth hollow stem like a straw 
through which if you drink you die. 
Hemlock from cow parsley 
      the blind man better tells. 
Impossible to know by sight 
      the difference in smell.
Green cow parsley seeds look like a supreme court 
of alien slugs in tiny horsehair wigs. 
Green hemlock seeds look like a handful of jacks 
in the fist of an invisible boy. 
The stem of poison hemlock 
      is like a drunkard's skin: 
purple blotches advertise 
      toxicity within. 
Dry cow parsley seeds are black cloven hooves, tapered 
elegantly like those of sacred cows in Hindu frescos. 
Dry hemlock seeds are Chinese sky lanterns crowding 
the air above the funeral of one who ate hemlock seeds. 
Cow parsley is a bitter herb 
      and hemlock it is sweet. 
The taste of one will bother none 
      if he the other eats. 
Cow parsley is the desire to restore to verse 
something of its original mnemonic function. 
Hemlock is a distracting preoccupation 
with artifice and ornament. 
The Washington Post says that green burials are 
on the rise, as baby boomers plan for their future 
their graves marked with sprouting mushrooms
little kneecaps crawling up from the dirt's skin 
like Michael Brown decomposing into the concrete 
ending as natural product of the environment.
Elephants are now being born without tusks

I am familiar with this type of Middle Passage 
a loved one watching you move on without a trace 
the living inheriting an ocean of time
the sun rewiring the water-damaged insides 
cells desiring to go back from where they came 
The clouds eruptedslate gray, charcoal. Almost black.
Winds shredded sky, water cut skin, so Turner knew he
had no choice. He chartered a ship and tied himself to the
creaking mast.
It would have been the last thing his mother said 
to him, to him and Em, that miserable 
visit, early in their marriage,
the final cutting thing 
on their way out to the car, 
standing before it 
after a weekend of 
the usual swipes, some subtle 
belittlement or other to share 
between them, though more 
at Em than him, he thinks,
but truly he forgets 
what it was that had him 
lunging at his mothertoo quick for him 
to be amazed at himself, even
but he did, his arms around her 
back and back of the head, 
the way you'd catch someone 
who was falling over. 
Except he was felling her, 
swinging her into a waltzer's dip 
and an abrupt halt, a hovering tableau 
over the front of the car. 
He thought he meant to say, 
Just shut the hell up. Enough. 
Shut up, but as he finished 
In the oasis of interior rest, come 
lie with me on a cushion 
of quantum foam 
in a sea of dark matter becoming 
lighter, like the insight of the blind
not caring if being watched or not 
seen at all, or seen with that look 
of the Law: implacable, insatiable, silent 
as night holding on to the eyes of the blind. 
From ballpark, birdcage, balconies, and malls 
comes from all sides a thousand- 
sided mirror of a thousand-sided sky 
blue that never arrives but stays 
wound around the crown 
of a human'swho knows why? 
Baylis Ritchie of Viper, 
Kentucky, near skeletal 
in this picture with his 
famous daughter Jean, 
picks a Cumberland 
dulcimer with a willow 
switch, as his girl's hands 
do the same, mirror each 
note and drone. He wrote 
"with that music you could 
make a mountain ring,"
and today along the Blue 
Ridge anyone with a fine 
ear can hear, keen eye can 
see peaks he summoned, 
forests of spruce, red cedar, 
oak and rosewood, any 
grain you'd need to shape 
a dulcimer, but don't even 
bother wishing you could play 
hourglass or teardrop zither 
so sweetly as Jean and Baylis, 
who plucked and strummed 
as one breath on "Pretty Saro," 
with that magic of kinship, 
a gift now nearly gone 
to clearcut and ground fog, 
hawk call and tainted wind, 
all the follies of modern man, 
though if you peer hard 
enough into this grainy 
photo and listen with your 
heart's full force, you can, I 
swear, hear that whispersweet 
pea, creeper, trillium, creek 
moss and homespun melody
locals call "blood harmony." 
Their pegs? Cut from a poplar. 
Fretboards: bittersweet cherry. 
Their "Wildwood Flower"voices 
elegant with lore and lovestill 
echoes through this ornery valley, 
Inside his plaid shirt, a scurry of moles.
While he naps, a lone brave nose
whiskers the air, and they all venture out,
once, twice, three times
around his body. And hurry back in,
on a path between third and fourth button.
His brown wing tips, Thump and Wax,
gleam a language that goes on without him,
a word for the inside
ground dark from his heel.
His tale, Tar Baby, his creature,
The Snout with its air-bladder lung.
His water feature, bog, his collections,
erasers and rubber cement. His lips,
bananas, his nose like the wrong middle wish.
His genie like stacked inner tubes
rubber-bumpering in and out of the jar.
He built three sieves for the garden.
Which part of dirt did he keep?
Silt for a blanket, gravel for pillow,
fat pebbles for sleep?
From dreams of varmints
who vanish his turnips,
who leave him half-radishes,
he wakes up smiling
but doesn't remember.
After lunch
and before he went
back to the fields,
hed catch a nap
there, a quick 15
minutes he said
percolated him. Hes in
the fields for good now
and in that chair,
now in my living room,
In a precisely lighted room, the CFO speaks
of start-to-start dependencies.
Says let me loop back with you.
Says please cascade as appropriate.
It's that time of morning; we all can smell
the doughnut factory. If scent were white
noise, doughnuts would be that scent.
The factory won't sell at any price.
The building next to it burns the animals
we experiment on. I have worked
on a few preclinical reports in my time.
The rhesus monkeys become
so desperate that they attempt suicide,
over and over again. I am legally obligated
to spare you the particulars.
How could things be any different?
Here many choice molecules have been born.
Here. This pill will dissolve like sugar.
I'm not sure why I glanced back
At the bus driver grinding a cigarette butt
With her heel into the gravel driveway.
She was a figure from a myth, from
One of his poems, a stranger, a guardian
Marking the passage to the other world.
Maybe she was just another way
Of distracting myself from the burial,
From waiting in clumsy silence
With the other mourners, all the forlorn
Gathered at the graveside without a rabbi
Or a priest to lead us in prayer.
It could be said that we were godless,
Haunted, lost, as we stood there
In the vanishing light and light rain.
Perhaps we had given up too much
The fundamental beliefs, the consoling rituals
That would have made the day more bearable.
But as we huddled together in the afternoon,
Quivering a little in the chill mist, muffling our sobs,
Looking up every now and then at the tall pines,
We felt something lonely moving amongst us,
A current almost, a small gust of wind,
Not a ghost exactly, nothing like that,
"Truth"says the truism"has a scratched face."
Tell me
the story of that scratch.

"If it thows it," said the mechanic in Macon,
"if it thows a rod, you gon know it."
I knew it
not. Every mile in that red Fairlane
with each pothole or engine-clunk
I worried it had already thrown it
and I was too oblivious to tell.
*
"Like a compound bone fracture
breaking through the skin," says Car Talk:
when the crankshaft's connecting rod
busts loose and splits through the engine block. It
throws a rod. Truth
has a clawed face. Truth
spine-bristles, spits back.

Sud-scraping the soap dish:
old soap needs new
to scrub off the soap scum
from latherslab that floated
in handwashing water, dried, then fouled
along the dish ridges: fat-gunk and fetor.
It takes soap to wash off soap, as
only words can say
what other words
might mean.
Antonymous ≠
its synonyms
inimical, oppugnant, dead against,
and the like.
*
If it thows it and you don't even know it:
Fairlane cruising while the rod
secretly and inwardly
blasts loose.
Truth's face so gashed you don't recognize it.
What does this proverb mean to you:
"One cannot be
and have been?"
What lather can cleanse the soap scum
of a question I heard in a philosophy lecture
forty years ago:
"What's the difference between no longer being
and never having been?"
It thows it, sometimes, and you know it.
"Big flies," the adage goes, "break the spider web." Silk-
wrapped in it; thorax torn and tearing: dead
against it.

"Sir, I'll tell you your problem, sir. Sir, you ain't got no engine, sir"'
The ex-Marine mechanic scowled down the open hood,
cicada-buzzthrob through dry miles of kudzu and gnat-swarm
in eye-wet.
"Well, what's that?" I asked, pointing at the engine.
"Sir, believe me, you ain't got no engine. Sir."
I ain't got no engine. It thowed it. I should have known it.
Gas-blast in cylinder
blows piston to connecting
rod to crankshaft to
wheel-screech and dust cloud in rearview,
but now: dead-clunk of rod half smashed through block.
I ain't got no. I ain't got no. I ain't got no.

"The truth lies,"
They say, "at the bottom of a well."
"It's unnecessary,"
They say too, "to fish up every bucket
that falls into the well."
It takes
words to scratch through to the truth
of words: verity, conformity, reality, the like.
Meaning's
the handle that metal-scrapes
and clangs against
language, its bobbing and disattached bucket,
when I go for a draft:
slime-green, algal, cold.
Scratch means "nothing." Arbitrary
no time
to set off from,
to floor it toward
never having been,
rod holding steady to its piston. Like any word, truth
slinks away when you say it:
spit-slicked, stripe-scratched, gut-
growling, and declawed.

Still floating on the current,
this last stretch before the sea,
like so many we fished together
through what seemed an endless river
of summer afternoonsthis one
as familiar as it isn't, hurrying more
the further we goour conversations
about the words of which things are made,
stilled now to become just the things
themselves, the purling and the rings
of water reaching out from our casts,
heard now only with our eyes
as I stand in the bow, watching
my fly float high on its hackle
along the grassy bank,
careful not to let my gaze
drift back to where
you would always be,
sitting behind me, a wreath
of cigarette smoke
the strange feeling you said
you sometimes had, letting
a trout go after all
the concentration of catching it
more like Mozart
than Wagner, you said,
your good right eye
watching for the rise of a life
your blind left, not too far
downstream, already absorbed
Jade-starred       entity
lacing                 embarking in
the self-spun                 curve
of recursive           tailspin
tangled              in turquoise
underwater       bluegrass
stealth-steps          like arabesque
a form             slips eternal
 
Corps de Ballet
A raft of tulle hovers
over feet in croisé:
skirts levitated under
arms' undulating
stems in photographic
white-life : twilit
mast mi-creature
or marine
 
The hare crosses each lost cantref
of Scotland hedgerow by hedgerow.
Every parish she encounters
leap by leap dissolves below
her movement over time. She lopes
from Pitlochry to Pitmedden,
from Glasgow to Linlithgow, hops
inch by inch into the melting
winter of another culture.
The hare is the white crescent moon.
Behind her time like a lurcher
stalks the fields and the open moor.
Mist blurs their grey pelts to a smirr,
flecks of words, names of the once great
kings and thanes bristle on their fur.
Their hides itch with priests and prelates.
The hare is a brief stretch that strays
across ditches, is set couchant
on her hunkers, ears twitching ways
like a dowser of air, silent,
nosing curt crows from the cut corn.
But the lurcher pushes on. Still
insistent, determined, the born
instinct to pursue for the kill
unfaltering. Now they're passing
under turbines and power lines,
their fleet flexible forms flashing
swiftly as they flit on through time.
 
I look out a window in passing
and an angel is standing in my garden.
A gift of alignment: the sun in rising
behind the cemetery next door
has cast that statue into ground fog.
A nuance to the new day, the visitor's
no flat reflection, he's the original's
counterpart garbed in marble folds
of shadow, dimensional within
the dense center of the cloud, wings
unfurled over the furrows. I hurry out
because my grandfather claimed
that foggy days were the luckiest
for planting a garden.
Only yesterday ice crystals
from an out-of-season snow
flexed the light to red, yellow, green.
By noon those harvest colors had gone
into the ground, preparing for roots.
The roto-tiller's handles
quivered like a divining rod.
Careful not to start an air current
and roil the fog stone, I step into the plot.
Beneath a shadow wing
I put in the first of the tomato plants
that as seeds I pressed into starter pots.
I remember as a boy watching my grandfather
breathe on each root before tamping it in.
He answered that in County Cork
they say you'd be a damned fool not to.
A charm against unfruitfulness, he called it.
So I take pleasure in not being able
to tell my breath from the root I hold.
What I aspire to is the example of the day moon,
seeing and being seen,
emeritus, laying my moon hands,
which are as immune from prosecution
as a diplomat's hands,
on your stomach, forehead, cheek, nape,
all around both of your thighs, playing
tic-tac-toe,
or Scrabble, or cribbage,
shaking out my moon dice
